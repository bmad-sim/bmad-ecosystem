Generalized_Gradients_Fit Program Documentation:
------------------------------------------------

The main purpose of this program is to calculate generalized gradient (GG) coefficients starting
from a field table for use in a Bmad lattice file. The field table may be for either magnetic or
electric fields. Note: The GG coefficients do not depend upon the type (magnetic or electric) of
field being used. The distinction between electric and magnetic is done in the lattice file.

This program can also be used to manipulate field tables and GG coefficient tables.

This documentation file and source code is in the directory:
  util_programs/generalized_gradients_fit


=================================================================================================
Running the Program
-------------------

To run the program use the command:
  generalized_gradients_fit <file_name>
where <file_name> is the name of the parameter file (see below). 
The default name, if <file_name> is not given, is "gg_fit.init".


=================================================================================================
Input Files:
------------

There are two input files:
  1) A program parameter file controlling how the program runs and 
  2) A field table or GG derivative file.

Example input files can be found at:
  util_programs/generalized_gradients_fit/example


=================================================================================================
Field Table File
----------------

There are three formats for the field table: ASCII, Binary, and Bmad lattice format. If the name of
the file containing the field table has a ".bmad" suffix, it will be assumed that the file is a Bmad
lattice file with one of the lattice elements containing a field table. If the name has a ".binary"
suffix, it will be assumed that the file has a binary format. For any other name, the file will be
assumed to be in ASCII format.

For the ASCII format The field table must have 7 header lines that look like:

0.01            ! File length_scale in meters. EG: 0.01 => Positions are in cm.
1e-4            ! File field_scale in Tesla or V/m. EG: 1e-4 => Field in Gauss (if magnetic).
0.4  0.2  0.2   ! del_x,y,z  Spacing between grid points in table units (not meters).
0    0    0     ! r0 (x,y,z) offset of the origin.

The remaining lines have the format:
  x-position    y-position  z-position   Field_x   Field_y   Field_z

The x, y and z-positions must be multiples of del_x, del_y, an del_z respectively.

Binary format files are used for quick parsing of the field table. Note: it is not clear that with
the present speed of computers that this ability to create binary files is useful. Binary files can
be created by setting the "mode" parameter in the parameter file to "binary" (see below).

If the field table file is a bmad lattice file, the lattice will be searched for the first element
in the lattice with a field table. If there are multiple elements with field tables, all other
tables besides the first will be ignored.

The (r0_x, r0_y) components of the r0 parameter shift the grid field so that the (x,y) position of
a field grid point with indexes (ix, iy) is
	(x, y) = (ix*del_x + r0_x, iy*del_y + r0_y)
The GG coefficients are always calculated with respect to (x,y) = (0,0).  that is, center line for
calculating the GG coefficients is at (-r0_x, -r0_y) with respect to the field grid. In the Bmad
lattice output file the (r0_x, r0_y) components of the GG map will be zero which makes the grid
field and GG map consistent with each other. The r0_z component of r0 is not used in the calculation
and the r0_z component of the GG map in the output bmad lattice file (in meters) will equal to the
value in the grid field table.

=================================================================================================
Parameter File:
---------------

See the "GG to Field Table" section of this file for documentation on how to convert from GG
coefficients to a field table file. For all other modes which convert field table to GG, the
parameter file will look like:

&params                    ! This line signals the beginning of the parameter list
  field_file = "w22-20_25_94.table.binary"  ! Field table file. .binary suffix => binary file.
  out_file = "gg"          ! Output file prefix. Output files will have suffixes like ".dat" and ".bmad".
  every_n_th_plane = 1     ! If equal 2, skip every other z-plane, etc.
  n_deriv_max = 4          ! Max derivative order output order. Min order is zero.
  n_deriv_extra = 0        ! Extra derivatives used in the fit. Derivative range in fit is [0, n_deriv_max+n_deriv_extra].
  m_cos = -1               ! List of m-values for cosine like GG. -1 => no cosine GG.
  m_sin =  1, 3, 5         ! List of m-values for sine like GG.
  z_min = 3                ! z-plane lower bound to start calc at. If not present, use field table lower bound.
  z_max = 13               ! z-plane upper bound to stop calc at. If not present, use field table upper bound.
  mode = "fit"             ! or "binary" to create a binary field table file.
  optimizer = "lm"         ! Optimizer to use. Alternative is "lmdif".
  n_planes_add = 0         ! Extra planes to use for the analysis
  core_weight = 1          ! Merit function weight on "core" (points with (x,y) near (0,0)) field table points.
  outer_plane_weight = 1   ! Merit function weight for the "outer" z-planes. Default is 1 (uniform weighting).
  sym_x = 1                ! X-axis symmetry. Possibilities are: -1, 0 (default), 1.
  sym_y = -1               ! Y-axis symmetry. Possibilities are: -1, 0 (default), 1.
  ele_anchor_pt = "beginning" ! or "center" or "end". Used to construct lattice file.
  x_pos_plot = 0, 0.02, 0.05  ! x-positions (in meters) to create a plotting file.
  y_pos_plot = 0, 0.01, 0.02  ! y-positions (in meters) to create a plotting file.
/                        ! Ending slash signals end of param list. Everything outside is ignored.

field_file: Name of the file containing the field table or GG derivatives. If the name has a ".bmad"
suffix, it will be assumed that the file is a Bmad lattice file. If the name has a ".binary" suffix,
it will be assumed that the file has a binary format. For any other name, the file will be assumed
to be in ASCII format.

out_file: Prefix used for naming output file(s).

ele_anchor_pt: Anchor point of the map. See the Bmad manual for more details. Not used in any
calculation and just used when constructing the compatible Bmad lattice file with the GG
derivatives. Default is "beginning"

every_n_th_plane: This parameter can be used to reduce the number of z-planes being analyzed. A
setting of "1" means analyze all z-planes, "2" means skip every other z-plane, etc. Use this parameter
if you want to reduce the amount of data being outputted.

n_deriv_extra: Extra derivatives used in the fit above n_deriv_max. That is, in the fitting process
the derivatives of order 0 through n_deriv_max+n_deriv_extra will be used. The default is 0.

n_deriv_max: For any given z-position, this parameter sets the maximum derivative order outputted to
the lattice file. The minimum derivative order is zero so the number of derivatives will be
n_deriv_max+1.

m_cos, m_sin: Lists of cosine and sine azimuthal harmonics to analyze. A list of "-1" means there
are no harmonics of this type. In the above example, no cosine harmonics are used and harmonics
of order 1, 3, and 5 are used.

z_min, z_max: Range of z-planes to analyze. In units of meters. If not present of z_min is lower then
the table lower bound, the beginning of the range will be the table lower bound. A similar logic holds
for z_max.

mode: See the Modes section

optimizer: There are two optimizers that can be used: "lm" and "lmdif". Both are variants of the
Levenburg-Marquardt algorithm. It is expected that the two optimizers should give the same results. 
And "lm" should be faster than "lmdif". So the only reason for using "lmdif" is for testing purposes.
See the "How the GG Calculation Works" section below for documentation on the optimizer merit function.

n_planes_add: The parameter sets the number of z-planes added to either side of the base z-plane to
be used in the analysis of the derivatives at any given base z-plane (see "How the GG Calculation
Works" section). For example, for n_planes_add = 2, two planes would be added to either side of the
base plane making the total number of planes used in the analysis equal to five.

core_weight: Merit function weight for "core" points (field table points whose transverse (x,y)
position is near (0,0)). Default is 1.0 which gives an equal weight for all points of a given
z-plane. See the "How the GG Calculation Works" section below for documentation on the optimizer
merit function.

outer_plane_weight: Merit function weight for z-planes away from the base z-plane when n_planes_add
is non-zero. See the "How the GG Calculation Works" section below for documentation on the optimizer
merit function.

sym_x and sym_y: These parameters set the symmetry of the field at constant z with respect to the
x-axis and the y-axis. This is used when the field table only contains one quadrant or one half of
the the field region in the (x,y) plane. Using a reduced region for a table is a way of reducing the
table file size. If the table covers the full field region, sym_x and sym_y should be set to 0 which
will prevent the program from trying to use symmetry in the calculation. sym_x = 1 means there is
mirror symmetry with respect to the x-z plane and -1 means there is anti-symmetry with respect to
the x-z plane. Similarly for sym_y with respect to the y-z plane. Example: A quadrupole magnet has
mirror anti-symmetry with respect to both the x-z and y-z planes and a skew quadrupole magnet has
mirror symmetry with respect to both planes.

x_pos_plot, y_pos_plot: List of x and y-positions in meters used to create files for plotting fit,
data and difference (fit-data) field values vs z-position. The files will be in a sub-directory
called "plot_data".  For each x-position and y-positions pair a file will be created. For a given
(x_pos_plot, y_pos_plot), the field values of the nearest points (ignoring r0) to this position will
be used.


=================================================================================================
How the GG Calculation Works:
-----------------------------

The GG coefficients are calculated at equally spaced z-positions corresponding to z-planes of the
field table. GG coefficients are calculated by varying the coefficients to achieve the minimum of a
"merit function". This fitting is done z-plane by z-plane. That is, the coefficients of a given
z-plane are calculated independently of the coefficients of any other z-plane and all coefficients
of a given z-plane are calculated simultaneously. For a given z-plane, The merit function is
  Merit = Sum over field points: weight * (field_from_table - field_calculated_from_GG_coefs)^2

The z-plane at which the GG coefficients are being calculated is called the "base plane". The merit
function is calculated by a sum over those field points that lie in a z-plane that is within
n_planes_add of the base plane. For example, for n_planes_add = 2, two planes would be added to
either side of the base plane making the total number of planes used in the analysis equal to
five. Near the ends of the table, the number of z-planes used will be reduced. Thus, for
n_planes_add = 2, a base z-plane at the end of the table will only use three planes in the analysis.

To calculate the field at a non-base plane, the GG coefficients of the base plane are extrapolated
to the non-base plane. For each GG specified by the m_cos and m_sin parameters, the extrapolating
polynomial is
  GG(dz) = GG(0) + dz * GG'(0) + dz^2 * GG''(0) / 2! + ...
where GG(dz) is the generalized gradient at a distance dz away from the base plane, GG' is the first
derivative, etc.  The order of the polynomial is given by n_deriv_max.

Adding extra planes to the analysis smooths the calculated values. The approximation that the GG
curve is well fit by a polynomial with coefficients given by the derivatives at the base
plane becomes less accurate as more planes are used in the analysis. Therefore, past some limit,
using more planes will make the calculation less accurate.

The weight for a given field point is determined by the setting of the core_weight and
outer_plane_weight parameters. The weight is a product of two factors:
  weight(x,y,dz) = w_core(x,y) * w_plane(dz)
where (x,y,dz) are the coordinates of the field point with respect to the base plane.

The w_core(x,y) factor is computed from:
  w_core(x,y) = core_weight * rmax^2 / (rmax^2 + r^2 * (core_weight - 1))
where r^2 = x^2 + y^2 and rmax is the maximum r over all points. A setting of core_weight of 1 (the
default) means that w_core is a constant. A setting of w_core greater than 1 means that the core
points (points with low r) will have higher weight at the expense of points farther away. A better
core fit is generally what is wanted since particles of a beam will spend most of their time near
the core.

The w_plane(dz) factor is computed from:
  w_plane(dz) = 1 + (outer_plane_weight - 1) * |dz| / dz_max
where dz_max is the maximum dz at the ends of the fit region. If n_planes_add = 0 (in which case
dz_max is zero and the above equation is singular), the above equation is ignored and a value of 1
is used for w_plane. A setting of outer_plane_weight of 1 (the default) means that w_plane is a
constant. To weight the planes nearer to the base plane more than the outer planes, choose a value
less than 1 but still non-negative.

Note: In theory, the merit function fitting does not require that the field table be a rectangular
grid of equally spaced points. In fact, a set of randomly spaced field points would work. The
generalized_gradient fit program, however, is not presently configured to handle non-rectangular
grids.


=================================================================================================
Operation Modes
---------------

  mode = "ascii": In this mode a field table is read in and an ASCII field table is written.
If z_min or z_max is set, the created file will only contain data within these bounds plus
n_planes_add to either side.

  mode = "binary": In this mode there is no analysis and a binary table is created
with a ".binary" suffix. This binary table can be used for the field_file in which case reading in the
table will be faster (it is not clear that with the present speed of computers that this ability to
create binary files is useful). If z_min or z_max is set, the created file will only contain
data within these bounds plus n_planes_add to either side. 

  mode = "fit": In this mode the standard GG analysis is done.

  mode = "output_table": This mode is used to convert GGs to a field table. See below.

  mode = "truncate_gg": In this mode, GG derivatives are read in from a Bmad lattice file and a
Bmad compatible output file is created with the number of derivatives truncated (if n_deriv_max is set
non-negative) and/or the z-extent limited (if Nz_min and/or Nz_max are set).


=================================================================================================
Output:
-------

With mode = "fit", There are multiple output files.

.deriv file: One output file is meant to be used for plotting derivative values. The name of this
file is given by the out_file parameter with a ".deriv" suffix attached. There are multiple data
sets in the table, one for each GG curve of the derivatives versus z-position. With Gnuplot,
individual data sets can be graphed using the Gnuplot "index" parameter.

This .deriv file also has a column labeled "Init_RMS" with the initial RMS of the field data used in
the calculation for a particular base plane. and a column labeled "RMS/RMS0" giving the final rms of
the residual of the fit minus the data divided by the initial RMS. A value small compared to one
indicates a good fit.

.deriv_at_rmax file: Another output file gives information on how significant the derivative values
are. The name of this file is given by the out_file parameter with a ".deriv_at_rmax" suffix
attached. The data blocks in this file might look like:

# m    = 3
# type = sin
# Iz     z_pos    Deriv * r_max^(m+d-1) * (d+m) * m! / ((d/2)! * (d/2+m)!)
  10    0.0200   3.07486025E-01  1.07290432E+00 -2.07656736E-01 -2.59055645E-01 
  11    0.0220   3.32020880E-01  9.37495727E-01 -3.12597302E-01 -2.10447354E-01 
  12    0.0240   3.52985405E-01  7.64678462E-01 -3.94031086E-01 -7.38811389E-02 

Column three and above show the significance of a the derivatives. The field due to a finite given
derivative scales roughly as r^(m+d-1) (plus some other factors) where "r" is the radius and "d" is
the derivative index. So at the outer edges of the table, the contribution of the derivative will
be a maximum and this is what is given in the table. Only the relative numbers are import. For example,
in the above table, the first derivatives (d = 1) contribute more than the other three derivatives. 

.left_deriv_diff and .right_deriv_diff files: From the derivative fit at a given z-plane, the value
of a GG and its derivatives can be computed from extrapolation at any other z-plane. If everything
is perfect and the derivatives higher than n_derivative_max are negligible, derivatives extrapolated
to a given z-plane should be equal to the derivatives calculated at that z-plane. The
.left_deriv_diff file gives the difference between the derivatives at a z-plane minus the
derivatives calculated by extrapolation from the neighbor z-plane with index one less than the
z-plane under consideration.  Similarly, the .right_deriv_diff file gives the difference between the
derivatives at a z-plane minus the derivatives calculated by extrapolation from the neighbor z-plane
with index one greater than the z-plane under consideration. To the extent that values in these
files are non-zero, this gives an indication of the goodness of how well the GG decomposition is
fitting the field.

plot_data files: Other files that can be used for plotting are put in the plot_data directory. Each
one of these files have a table of fit and input data field versus z-position at a fixed (x,y)
position. The (x,y) positions used to generate these files is given by the x_pos_plot and y_pos_plot
parameters.  See above for more details.

.bmad lattice file: The final output file has the derivative values in bmad lattice format. The name
of this file is given by the out_file parameter with a ".bmad" suffix attached. This file may be
called from another lattice file. For example, if the output file is called gg.bmad the following
will call the file:
  q1: quadrupole, l = 0.6, call::gg.bmad


=================================================================================================
GG to Field Table
-----------------

Converting an existing GG to a field table can be useful, for example, in comparing the accuracy
of different GG parameterizations. An example parameter file to convert GG to a field table is:

&params                  ! This line signals the beginning of the parameter list
  mode = "output_table"    ! GG -> field table mode.
  field_file = "lat.bmad"  ! Bmad lattice with a lattice element with GG 
  out_file = "table.dat"   ! Name of field table file to be created.
  length_scale = 0.01      ! File length_scale in meters. EG: 0.01 => Positions are in cm.
  field_scale = 1e-4       ! File field_scale in Tesla or V/m. EG: 1e-4 => Field in Gauss (if magnetic).
  del_grid = 0.4, 0.2      ! del_x,y  Spacing between grid points in table units (not meters).
  r0_grid = 0, 0, 0        ! r0 (x,y,z) offset of the origin. 
  Nx_min = -5              ! X-coordinate lower bound.
  Nx_max = 5               ! X-coordinate upper bound.
  Ny_min = 0               ! Y-coordinate lower bound.
  Ny_max = 3               ! Y-coordinate upper bound.
  Nz_min = -200            ! Z-coordinate lower bound.
  Nz_max =  200            ! Z-coordinate upper bound.
/                        ! Ending slash signals end of param list. Everything outside is ignored.


field_file: Here this is the name of the Bmad lattice file.  The lattice will be searched for the
first element in the lattice with a gen_grad_map. If there are multiple elements with gen_grad_maps,
other maps besides the first will be ignored.

del_grid: Field table grid spacing in x and y. del_grid(3) (z spacing) is set by the gen_grad_map in the
lattice file.

If Nz_min is absent from the parameter list, Nz_min will default to the lower bound of the GG map in the file.
If Nz_max is absent from the parameter list, Nz_max will default to the upper bound of the GG map in the file.
