Usage:
   bmad_to_mad_sad_elegant {-nobpm} {-noaperture} {-force} {-mad8} {-madx} {-sad} {-elegant} <bmad_file_name>

The created files will be created in the current directory.

The bmad_file_name will have a '.bmad' appended to the name if there
is no '.' in the original name.

The output file name will be the bmad_file_name with the '.bmad' suffix
(or whatever suffix is there) replaced by:
      '.mad8'       for MAD8 files.
      '.madx'       for MAD-X files.
      '.sad'        for SAD files.
			'.lte'        for Elegant files.

Lattices with and without bpm markers can be generated by using the "-nobpm" option. 
This is useful for cesr lattices where bpms within a quad will produce drifts with negative lengths.
 
For MAD8 or SAD translations: By default, if a non-collimator element has an aperture, the translated
lattice will include an added zero length collimator element next to the element in question.
If the "-noaperture" option is present the aperture info is discarded an no extra element is added.
Note: MADX translations for non-drift elements can handle non-collimator elements with an aperture so 
in this case this argument is ignored.

For SAD translations: If the "-force" option is present, this forces translation even when no reference
orbit and twiss parameters can be computed.
