\section{Equations of Motion}
\label{s:spin.dyn}

The propagation of the classical spin vector $\Bf S$ is described in the local reference
frame (\sref{s:ref}) by a modified Thomas-Bargmann-Michel-Telegdi
(T-BMT) equation\cite{b:spin.hoff}
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}s} \Bf S = 
  \left\{ \frac{(1+\Bf r_t \dotproduct \bfg)}{c \, \beta_z} \, 
  \left( {\pmb\Omega}_{BMT} + {\pmb\Omega}_{EDM} \right) - 
  \bfg \times \bfhat z \right\} \times \mathbf{S}
  \label{tbmt}
\end{equation}
where $\bfg$ is the bend curvature function which points away from the center of curvature
of the particle's reference orbit (see \fig{f:local.coords}), $\Bf r_t = (x, y)$ are the
transverse coordinates, $c \, \beta_z$ is the longitudinal component of the velocity, and
$\bfhat z$ is the unit vector in the $z$-direction. $\pmb\Omega_{BMT}$ is the usual T-BMT
precession vector due to the particle's magnetic moment
\begin{align}
  {\pmb\Omega}_{BMT} (\mathbf{r,P},t) &= 
    - \frac{q}{m \, c} \left[ 
    \left(\frac{1}{\gamma} + a \right) \, c \, \Bf B -
    \frac{a \, \gamma \, c}{1 + \gamma} \, ( \bfbeta \dotproduct \Bf B ) \, \bfbeta -
    \left( a + \frac{1}{1 + \gamma} \right) \, \mathbf{\bfbeta \times  E} 
    \right] \label{orpt} \\
  &= - \frac{q}{m \, c} \left[ 
    \left( \frac{1}{\gamma} + a \right) \, c \, \Bf B_{\perp} +
    \frac{(1 + a) \, c}{\gamma} \, \Bf B_\parallel -
    \left( a + \frac{1}{1 + \gamma} \right) \mathbf{\bfbeta \times E} 
    \right] \nonumber
\end{align}
and $\pmb\Omega_{EDM}$ is the
precession vector due to a finite Electric Dipole Moment (EDM) \cite{b:silenko}\footnote
  {
Note: The value for the EDM is set by \vn{bmad_com[electric_dipole_moment]} (\sref{s:bmad.common}).
  }
\begin{equation}
  {\pmb\Omega}_{EDM} (\mathbf{r,P},t) = 
  - \frac{q \, \eta}{2 \, m \, c} \left[
  \Bf E - \frac{\gamma}{1 + \gamma} \, 
  ( \bfbeta \dotproduct \Bf E ) \, \bfbeta +
  c \, \mathbf{\bfbeta \times B}
  \right]
\end{equation}
Here $\Bf E (\Bf r ,t)$ and $\Bf B (\Bf r ,t)$ are the electric and magnetic fields, $\Bf B_\perp$
and $\Bf B_\parallel$ are the components perpendicular and parallel to the particle's momentum,
$\gamma$ is the particle's relativistic gamma factor, $q$, and $m$ are the particle's charge and
mass, $\bfbeta$ is the normalized velocity, $a = (g-2)/2$ is the particle's anomalous magnetic
moment (values given in Table~\ref{t:constants}), and $\eta$ is the normalized electric dipole
moment which is related to the dipole moment $\Bf d$ via
\begin{equation}
  \Bf d = \frac{\eta}{2} \, \frac{q}{m \, c} \, \Bf S
\end{equation}
Note: Some authors define $\eta$ without the factor of $c$ is the denominator.

It is important to keep in mind that the $a$ and $g$-factors used here are defined using \Eq{mgq2m}
which, in the case of nuclei and other composite baryonic particles, differs from the conventional
definition \Eq{mgq2m2}. See the discussion after \Eq{mgq2m}.

\section{Quaternions and Biquaternions}
\label{s:quat}

\bmad uses a quaternion representation for spin rotations\cite{b:quat} and for the single resonance
analysis (\sref{s:spin.res}) it is convenient to use biquaternions which are quaternions with
complex coefficients. The following is a brief introduction to quaternions and biquaternions. For
more information, the reader is referred to the literature\cite{b:biquat}.

WARNING! It is important when looking at software or documentation to keep in mind that there are
multiple conventions that are used to define quaternions! The ``\vn{Hamilton}'' convention used here
is widely used in mathematics, physics and other fields. The ``\vn{JPL}'' (Jet Propulsion
Laboratory) and ``\vn{STS}'' (``space shuttle'') conventions are generally confined to use in
areospace and robotics contexts\cite{b:yazell,b:sommer}.

A quaternion $\bfq$ is a 4-component object:
\begin{equation}
  \bfq = q_0 + q_x \, \cali + q_y \, \calj + q_z \, \calk
  \label{qqqqq}
\end{equation}
where $q_0$, $q_x$, $q_y$, and $q_z$ are real numbers for quaternions and complex numbers for
biquaternions. $\cali$, $\calj$, and $\calk$ are the {\em fundamental quaternion units} with the
properties under multiplication
\begin{equation}
  \cali^2 = \calj^2 = \calk^2 = \cali \, \calj \, \calk = -1, \quad 
  \cali \, \calj = \calk, \quad \calj \, \cali = -\calk, \quad \text{etc.}
\end{equation}
$\cali$, $\calj$, and $\calk$ do not commute among themselves but do commute with real or complex
numbers. It is important to keep in mind the difference between the quaternion unit $\cali$
and the imaginary number $i$ which is not the same.

Explicitly, the product of two bi/quaternions (that is, two quaternions or biquaternions) is
\begin{align}
  \bfb \, \bfa = &(a_0 b_0 - a_x b_x - a_y b_y - a_z b_z) +
                  (a_0 b_x + a_x b_0 + a_y b_z - a_z b_y) \, \cali + \\
                 &(a_0 b_y - a_x b_z + a_y b_0 + a_z b_x) \, \calj +
                  (a_0 b_z + a_x b_y - a_y b_x + a_z b_0) \, \calk \nonumber
\end{align}

The $q_0$ component of a quaternion $\bfq$ is called the \vn{scalar} part and will be denoted by
$S(\bfq)$.  the $q_x \cali + q_y \calj + q_z \calk$ part is called the \vn{vector} part and will be
denoted $\bfV(\bfq)$. That is:
\begin{equation}
  \bfq = S(\bfq) + \bfV(\bfq)
\end{equation}
A bi/quaternion with $S(\bfq)$ equal to zero is called a ``\vn{pure}'' quaternion.
the quaternion product in terms of $S$ and $\bfV$ is
\begin{equation}
  \bfp \, \bfq = S(\bfp) S(\bfq) + S(\bfp) \bfV(\bfq) + S(\bfq) \bfV(\bfp) + \bfV(\bfp) \bfV(\bfq)
\end{equation}
and, if $\bfV(\bfp)$ and $\bfV(\bfq)$ are considered as vectors, the last term $\bfa \equiv
\bfV(\bfp) \bfV(\bfq)$ in the above equation can be written as
\begin{equation}
  S(\bfa) = -\bfV(\bfp) \cdot \bfV(\bfq), \qquad \bfV(\bfa) = \bfV(\bfp) \cross \bfV(\bfq)
\end{equation}

In the literature, the scalar part is sometimes called the \vn{real} part and the vector part is
sometimes called the \vn{imaginary} part. In this manual, this nomenclature is avoided to avoid
confusion with the real and imaginary parts of complex numbers. Here $\re(\bfq)$ and $\im(\bfq)$ are
defined to be the real and imaginary parts of the biquaternion.
\begin{align}
  \re(\bfq) &\equiv \re(q_0) + \re(q_x) \, \cali + \re(q_y) \, \calj + \re(q_z) \, \calk \CRNO
  \im(\bfq) &\equiv -i \left[ \im(q_0) + \im(q_x) \, \cali + \im(q_y) \, \calj + \im(q_z) \, \calk \right]
\end{align}

The dot product (inner product) of two bi/quaternions is defined to be the
standard Euclidean dot product in 4D:
\begin{equation}
  \bfa \dotproduct \bfb = a_0 \, b_0 + a_x \, b_x + a_y \, b_y + a_z \, b_z
\end{equation}
and the bi/quaternion norm $||\bfq||$ is given by
\begin{equation}
  ||\bfq|| \equiv \sqrt{\bfq \dotproduct \bfq} = \sqrt{q_0^2 + q_x^2 + q_y^2 + q_z^2}
  \label{1qqq}
\end{equation}
Notice that for quaternions the norm is positive or zero and real. On the other hand, the norm of a
biquaternion will, in general, be complex. For pure bi/quaternions, the \vn{complex norm}
is defined by 
\begin{equation}
  |\bfq| \equiv \sqrt{|q_x|^2 + |q_y|^2 + |q_z|^2}
\end{equation}
with the convention that quaternion norm uses double bars and complex norm uses a single bar. For
pure quaternions the two are equal.

The ``\vn{quaternion conjugate}'', $\BAR\bfq$, valid for both quaternions and biquaternions, is defined
by\footnote
  {
Different symbols are used in the literature. Here the use of ``*'' to denote the quaternion
conjugate is avoided to avoid confusion with complex conjugate.  Notice that even with
biquaternions, there is no complex conjugation when computing $\BAR\bfq$.
  }
\begin{equation}
  \BAR\bfq = q_0 - q_x \, \cali - q_y \, \calj - q_z \calk
\end{equation}
The quaternion conjugate has the properties
\begin{equation}
  \BAR{\bfq_1 \, \bfq_2} = \BAR\bfq_2 \, \BAR\bfq_1, \qquad 
  \BAR{S(\bfq)} = S(\bfq), \qquad 
  \BAR{\bfV(\bfq)} = -\bfV(\bfq)
\end{equation}
Along with the properties
\begin{equation}
  \bfp \cdot \bfq = \frac{1}{2} \, (\BAR\bfp \bfq + \BAR\bfq \bfp)
\end{equation}
The bi/quaternion inverse $\bfq^{-1}$ is related to the quaternion conjugate by
\begin{equation}
  \bfq^{-1} = \frac{\BAR\bfq}{||\bfq||^2}
\end{equation}

The biquaternion complex conjugate $\bfq^*$ is just the complex conjugate of the components
\begin{equation}
  \bfq^* = q_0^* + q_x^* \, \cali + q_y^* \, \calj + q_z^* \, \calk 
\end{equation}

When a quaternion represents a rotation, $\cali$, $\calj$, and $\calk$ can be thought of as representing unit
vectors along the three Cartesian axes $\bfx$, $\bfy$, and $\bfz$ respectively. A rotation through an angle
$\theta$ around the unit axis $\bfu = (u_x, u_y, u_z)$ is represented by the quaternion
\begin{equation}
  \bfq = \cos\frac{\theta}{2} + (u_x \, \cali + u_y \, \calj + u_z \, \calk) \sin\frac{\theta}{2}
  \label{qt2ui}
\end{equation}
A rotation quaternion $\bfq$ is a \vn{unit} quaternion since its norm is unity $||\bfq|| = 1$.

Given an ordinary spatial vector $(\bfr_x, \bfr_y, \bfr_z)$, this vector is represented by a
pure quaternion $\bfr = (0, \bfr_x, \bfr_y, \bfr_z)$. The rotation of $\bfr$ through a rotation
represented by quaternion $\bfq$ to position $\bfr'$ is given by
\begin{equation}
  \bfr' = \bfq \, \bfr \, \BAR\bfq
  \label{rqrq}
\end{equation}
The rotation matrix $\bfR$ corresponding to \Eq{rqrq} so that $\bfr' = \bfR \, \bfr$ is
\begin{equation}
  \bfR = \begin{pmatrix}
    q_0^2 + q_x^2 - q_y^2 - q_z^2    & 2 \, q_x \ q_y - 2 \, q_0 \, q_z & 2 \, q_x \ q_z + 2 \, q_0 \, q_y \\
    2 \, q_x \ q_y + 2 \, q_0 \, q_z & q_0^2 - q_x^2 + q_y^2 - q_z^2    & 2 \, q_y \ q_z - 2 \, q_0 \, q_x \\
    2 \, q_x \ q_z - 2 \, q_0 \, q_y & 2 \, q_y \ q_z + 2 \, q_0 \, q_x & q_0^2 - q_x^2 - q_y^2 + q_z^2 
  \end{pmatrix}
  \label{rqqq}
\end{equation}

Define functions $I_-(\bfn)$ and $I_+(\bfn)$ which map pure quaternions $\bfn = (0, n_x, n_y, n_z)$ to biquaternions
$\bfn^\mmin$ and $\bfn^\ppls$ via
\begin{align}
  \bfn^\ppls &\equiv I_+(\bfn) \equiv \frac{1}{2} + \frac{i}{2}  \big( n_x \, \cali + n_y \, \calj + n_z \, \calk \big) \CRNO
  \bfn^\mmin &\equiv I_-(\bfn) \equiv \frac{1}{2} - \frac{i}{2} \big( n_x \, \cali + n_y \, \calj + n_z \, \calk \big)
  \label{n1in}
\end{align}
It will be assumed throughout that $\bfn$ has unit magnitude $||\bfn|| = 1$ and has real components (is a quaternion).

For later use, the following identities are useful
\begin{alignat}{2}
   &\bfn^\ppls \bfn^\ppls = \bfn^\ppls, \qquad
  &&\bfn^\mmin \bfn^\mmin = \bfn^\mmin, \label{n6} \\
   &\bfn = i (\bfn^\mmin - \bfn^\ppls), \qquad
  &&\bfn^\ppls \bfn^\mmin = \bfn^\mmin \bfn^\ppls = \Bf 0 \CRNO
   &\BAR{\bfn^\ppls} = \bfn^\mmin, \qquad
  &&\BAR{\bfn^\mmin} = \bfn^\ppls
  \nonumber
\end{alignat}
The relations on the first row mean that $I_+(\bfn)$ and $I_-(\bfn)$ produce ``idempotent''
biquaternions\cite{b:biquat}.

For any biquaternions $\bfq$, $\bfn^\ppls = I_+(\bfn)$, and $\bfn^\mmin = I_-(\bfn)$, the biquaternion $\bfQ =
\bfn^\ppls \bfq \bfn^\mmin$ is pure. This follows from
\begin{equation}
  2 \, S(\bfQ) = \bfQ + \BAR\bfQ = 
  \bfn^\ppls (S(\bfq) + \BAR{S(\bfq)}) \bfn^\mmin + \bfn^\ppls (\bfV(\bfq) + \BAR{\bfV(\bfq)}) \bfn^\mmin
  = 2 \, S(\bfq) \, \bfn^\ppls \bfn^\mmin = 0
  \label{2sgg}
\end{equation}
Furthermore, the real and imaginary parts of $\bfQ$ have the following properties
\begin{align}
  & \re(\bfQ) \cdot \im(\bfQ) = 0 \CRNO
  & \re(\bfQ) \cdot \bfn = \im(\bfQ) \cdot \bfn = 0 
  \label{GG0} \\
  & |\re(\bfQ)| = |\im(\bfQ)| \nonumber
\end{align}
These relations are fairly easy to derive. For example, the last one is proved via
\begin{equation}
  4 \, | \re(\bfQ) |^2 = (\bfQ + \bfQ^*) \cdot (\bfQ + \bfQ^*) =
  \bfn^\ppls \bfq^2 \bfn^\ppls + \bfn^\mmin \bfq^2 \bfn^\mmin =
  -(\bfQ - \bfQ^*) \cdot (\bfQ - \bfQ^*) =
  4 \, | \im(\bfQ) |^2
  \label{4ggg}
\end{equation}
and since the magnitude of both $\re(\bfQ)$ and $\im(\bfQ)$ must be positive (since $\re$ and $\im$
produce real numbers), it follows that $|\re(\bfQ)| = |\im(\bfQ)|$.

\section{Invariant Spin Field}
\label{s:isf}

In a storage ring, the \vn{invariant spin field} $\bfn(\bfr, s) = (n_x, n_y, n_z)$
\cite{b:spin.hoff,b:duan15}, which is a function of phase space position $\bfr = (x, p_x, y, p_y, z,
p_z)$ and longitudinal position $s$, is the {\em continuous} function with unit amplitude that
satisfies
\begin{equation}
  \bfn(\Cal M_r \bfr, s) = \Cal M_s(\bfr) \, \bfn(\bfr, s)
  \label{nmrs}
\end{equation}
where $\Cal M_r$ is the orbital part of the 1-turn transfer map and $\Cal M_s(\bfr)$, derived from
T-BMT equation, is the spin part of the map which is a function of $\bfr$. That is, the invariant
spin field (ISF) obeys the T-BMT equation. Thus, a particle whose spin points in the direction of
$\bfn(\bfr, s)$ at some time $t$ will, in the absence of radiation effects, always have its spin
pointing in the direction of $\bfn(\bfr, s)$. When there are no resonances, $\bfn(\bfr, s)$ is
unique up to a flip of sign. 

In general, it is not straightforward to calculate $\bfn$. The exceptional case (besides the cases
where there is a resonance) is if the particle is on the closed orbit $\bfr_0$. In this case, since
$\Cal M_r \bfr_0 = \bfr_0$, and since $\Cal M_s(\bfr)$ is a rotation matrix, \Eq{nmrs} can be solved
to give the invariant spin field on the closed orbit denoted by $\bfn_0$.  Over one turn, a spin on
the closed orbit rotates around $\bfn_0$ by the angle $2 \pi \nu_0$ where $\nu_0$ is the
closed-orbit spin tune.

Only the fractional part of the closed orbit spin tune $\nu_0$ is generally well defined. That is,
it is not in general possible to distinguish between tunes $\nu_0+m$ where $m$ is an
integer.\footnote
  {
This is in contrast to the orbital tunes where the integer part is generally well defined (but there
are exceptions when there is strong coupling). The reason for this is that at all points in the
ring, the orbital normal mode axes are fairly well defined (see, for example, \Eq{avx}). This means
that the phase angle of an oscillating particle with respect to the axes is fairly well defined and
counting full oscillations is unambiguous. With spin, the closed orbit spin oscillations are in the
plane transverse to $\bfn_0$ and here there is no non-arbitrary way to define the transverse plane
coordinate axes (there is an exception here if $\bfn_0$ always is pointing in the same general
direction). This makes the integer part of the spin tune ambiguous.
  }
Additionally, if $\bfn_0$ is a valid closed orbit spin field then so is $-\bfn_0$ and the spin tune
associated with $-\bfn_0$ is the negative of the spin tune associated with $\bfn_0$.

Since the direction of $\bfn_0$ is arbitrary, \bmad uses the following convention: The range of the
spin tune is choisen to be $[0, \pi]$. From the 1-turn spin transport quaternian $\bfq$ (\Eqs{qqqqq} and
\eq{qt2ui}), the equation to calculate the tune is
\begin{equation}
  \theta = 2 \cdot \text{atan2}\left( \bigl| (q_x, q_y, q_z) \bigr|, |q_0| \right)
\end{equation}
where $\text{atan2}$ is the standard arc tangent function.
With this, $\bfn_0$ is given by
\begin{equation}
  \bfn_0 = \frac{\sign(q_0)}{\left| (q_x, q_y, q_z) \right|} \, ( q_x, q_y, q_z )
\end{equation}
where $\sign$ is the sign function. With this, the calculation of the tune and $\bfn_0$ is
independent of whether $\bfq$ or $-\bfq$ is used.

\section{Polarization Limits and Polarization/Depolarization Rates}
\label{s:spin.pol}

Once the invariant spin field (\sref{s:isf}) has been calculated, various quantities of interest can be
computed. For example, given some initial distribution of spins in a beam, the maximum possible time
averaged polarization $\left< \bfS \right>_{\max}$ is
\begin{equation}
  \left< \bfS \right>_{\max} = \int d\bfr \, \rho(\bfr) \, \bfn(\bfr)
\end{equation}
where the integral is over the beam phase space space density $\rho$ and the longitudinal
$s$-dependence is implicit. The above equation neglects any single spin polarization or
depolarization processes. Notice that what is calculated is a time averaged quantity.
Instantaneously, the beam can be fully polarized but the average over many turns, at some given
position $s$, cannot exceed $\left< \bfS \right>_{\max}$.

Another quantity that can be computed from knowledge of $\bfn$ is the equilibrium polarization of a
beam. The \vn{Baier-Katkov-Strakhovenko} polarization $P_{bks}$ (generalized from
\vn{Sokolov-Ternov} to include non-vertical fields) is calculated by ignoring deviations of the beam
from the closed orbit\cite{b:barber99}
\begin{equation}
  P_{bks} = \pm \frac{8}{5 \, \sqrt{3}}
  \frac{\displaystyle \oint ds \, g^3 \, \what\bfb \dotproduct \bfn_0}
  {\displaystyle \oint ds \, g^3 \left( 1 - \frac{2}{9} (\bfn_0 \dotproduct \what\bfs)^2 \right)}
  \label{pbks}
\end{equation}
where $g = 1/\rho$ is the bending strength ($\rho$ is the bending radius), $\what\bfs$ is the unit
vector in the direction of motion, and $\what\bfb$ is defined to be
\begin{equation}
  \what\bfb \equiv \frac{\what\bfs \cross d\what\bfs/ds}{|d\what\bfs/ds|}
\end{equation}
Notice that $\what\bfb$ is the direction of the magnetic field when $\what\bfs$ is perpendicular to
the magnetic field and when there is no electric field. In the above equation, the plus sign is for
positrons (polarized parallel to the field) and the minus sign is for electrons. Since the above
equation is only valid when the anomalous magnetic moment is small\cite{b:jackson}, this formula is
not valid for protons and anti-protons.

The corresponding BKS polarization build-up rate $\tau_{bks}^{-1}$ is
\begin{equation}
  \tau_{bks}^{-1} = \frac{5 \, \sqrt{3}}{8} \frac{r_e \, \gamma^5 \, \hbar}{m} \frac{1}{C} \,
    \oint ds \, g^3 \, \left( 1 - \frac{2}{9} (\bfn_0 \dotproduct \what\bfs)^2 \right)
  \label{tbks}
\end{equation}

If the stochastic excitation of the beam is taken into account, the generalized Sokolov-Ternov
polarization is called the \vn{Derbenev-Kondratenko} formula
\begin{equation}
  P_{dk} = \pm \frac{8}{5 \, \sqrt{3}}
  \frac{\displaystyle \oint ds \, \left< g^3 \, \what\bfb \dotproduct 
    \left( \bfn - \frac{\partial \bfn}{\partial \delta} \right) \right>}
  {\displaystyle \oint ds \, \left< g^3 \left( 1 - \frac{2}{9} (\bfn \dotproduct \what\bfs)^2 + 
    \frac{11}{18} \left| \frac{\partial \bfn}{\partial \delta} \right|^2 \right) \right>}
  \label{pdk85}
\end{equation}
where $<>$ denotes an average over phase space, and $\delta$ is the fractional energy deviation
which, for ultra-relativistic particles, is the same as phase space $p_z$. Since, away from any
resonances, $\bfn$ is very close to $\bfn_0$, and since generally machines are tuned away from any
resonances, the $\bfn - \partial\bfn/\partial\delta$ and $\bfn\cdot\what\bfs$ terms can be replaced
by $\bfn_0 - \partial\bfn/\partial\delta$ and $\bfn_0\cdot\what\bfs$ when evaluating $P_{dk}$.

The $\what\bfb \dotproduct \partial\bfn/\partial\delta$ term in \Eq{pdk85} is called the
``\vn{kinetic} \vn{polarization}'' term.

The time dependence of the polarization is \cite{b:barber99})
\begin{equation}
  \bfP(t) = \bfP_{dk} \, \left( 1 - \exp(-t/\tau_{dk}) \right) + \bfP_0 \, \exp(-t/\tau_{dk})
\end{equation}
where $\bfP_0$ is the initial polarization and the polarization rate $\tau_{dk}^{-1}$ is 
\begin{equation}
  \tau_{dk}^{-1} = \frac{5 \, \sqrt{3}}{8} \frac{r_e \, \gamma^5 \, \hbar}{m}
  \frac{1}{C} \, \oint ds \, \left< g^3 \, \left( 1 - \frac{2}{9} (\bfn \dotproduct \what\bfs)^2 + 
  \frac{11}{18} \left| \frac{\partial \bfn}{\partial \delta} \right|^2 \right) \right>
  \label{t583}
\end{equation}

$\tau_{dk}^{-1}$ can be decomposed into two parts:
\begin{equation}
  \tau_{dk}^{-1} = \tau_{pol}^{-1} + \tau_{dep}^{-1}
  \label{tdk}
\end{equation}
$\tau_{pol}^{-1}$ is the polarization rate given by the first two terms on the
RHS in \Eq{t583} and the depolarization rate $\tau_{dep}^{-1}$ is given by the third term:
\begin{align}
  \tau_{pol}^{-1} &= \frac{5 \, \sqrt{3}}{8} \frac{r_e \, \gamma^5 \, \hbar}{m} \frac{1}{C} \,
    \oint ds \, \left< g^3 \, \left( 1 - \frac{2}{9} (\bfn \dotproduct \what\bfs)^2 \right) \right> 
    \CRNO
  \tau_{dep}^{-1} &= \frac{5 \, \sqrt{3}}{8} \frac{r_e \, \gamma^5 \, \hbar}{m}
    \frac{1}{C} \, \oint ds \, \left< g^3 \,
    \frac{11}{18} \left| \frac{\partial \bfn}{\partial \delta} \right|^2 \right>
    \label{tdep}
\end{align}
$\tau_{pol}^{-1}$ is generally well approximated by the \vn{Baier-Katkov-Strakhovenko} polarization
rate (\Eq{tbks}). The difference being that $\tau_{bks}^{-1}$ is evaluated along the closed orbit
while $\tau_{pol}^{-1}$ involves an average over the transverse beam size.

The calculation of $P_{dk}$ (\Eq{pdk85}) and $\tau_{dep}^{-1}$ (\Eq{tdep}) involve integrating
$\partial\bfn/\partial\delta$ around the ring. The calculation of $\partial\bfn/\partial\delta$ at
any point in the ring involves a sum of eigenvectors $\bfn_k$, $k = 1, \ldots, 6$ (\Eq{ndan}) with
pairs of eigenvectors being associated with the three orbital modes of oscillation. Insight into the
decoherence process can had by considering what $P_{dk}$ and $\tau_{dep}^{-1}$ would be if only
one oscillation mode was being excited. This is done by calculating $\partial\bfn/\partial\delta$ with
\Eq{ndan} by using the two $\bfn_k$ for one particular mode and taking the other $\bfn_k$ to be zero.
This is then used in \Eq{pdk85} and \Eq{tdep}.

One problem in evaluating \Eq{pdk85} is that accurately evaluating the $\partial\bfn/\partial\delta$
terms over the transverse bunch distribution is complicated due to lattice nonlinearities. One way
to evaluate $P_{dk}$ with nonlinearities included is by tracking a bunch of particles over some
number of turns. To help minimize the needed tracking, the spin flip process can be neglected. With
this, and starting with 100\% polarization, a turn-by-turn plot of the polarization will give the
depolarization rate $\tau_{dep}^{-1}$. The integrals of $g^3 \, \what\bfb \dotproduct \bfn$ and $g^3
\, (1 - 2(\bfn \dotproduct \what\bfs)^2/9)$ can be well approximated by the integrals over the
closed orbit ignoring the finite beam size.  Finally, for most rings, the integral of $g^3 \what\bfb
\dotproduct \partial\bfn/\partial\delta$ is generally small compared to the integral of $g^3 \,
\what\bfb \dotproduct \bfn$ since, in most of the machine, $\what\bfb$ and $\bfn$ will point in the
vertical direction and $\partial\bfn/\partial\delta$ will be perpendicular to the vertical (see
\Eq{qq0}).  Putting this all together, the equilibrium polarization can be computed from
\begin{equation}
  P_{dk} \approx P_{bks} \frac{\tau_{bks}^{-1}}{\tau_{bks}^{-1} + \tau_{dep}^{-1}}
\end{equation}
where $\tau_{dep}^{-1}$ is calculated via particle tacking and the other quantities are calculated by
integrals over the closed orbit ignoring beam size effects.

\section{Bmad Tune and $n_0$ convention}
\label{s:spin.tune}

As mentioned above, at any point in a ring the direction of the closed orbit invariant spin $\bfn_0$
is ambiguous since, if $\bfn_0$ is a valid invariant spin direction, then so is $-\bfn_0$. The same
is true of the spin tune $\nu_0$ and if $\nu_0$ is the spin tune associated with $\bfn_0$, $-\nu_0$
is the spin tune associated with $-\bfn_0$. This ambiguity complicates various calculations. For
example, to do the integral in \Eq{pbks}, it is necessary to make sure that the direction of
$\bfn_0(s_1)$, the invariant spin at $s_1$, must be consistent with the direction of the invariant
spin at $s_2$, $\bfn_0(s_2)$. That is, the two must be related via
\begin{equation}
  \bfn_0(s_2) = \bfq_{21} \, \bfn_0(s_1) \, \BAR\bfq_{21}
  \label{n0qn0q}
\end{equation}
where $\bfq_{21}$ is the closed orbit spin transport quaternion from $s_1$ to $s_2$. The tune must
also be computed consistent with the choice of invariant spin direction. This is important when
calculating sum and difference resonance strengths (\Eqs{x12pq1} and \eq{x12pq2}).

To ensure a consistent invariant spin direction, \Eq{n0qn0q} is used when calculating integrals
involving $\bfn_0$. To ensure a consistent tune, \bmad uses the following convention that the spin
tune will always be in the range $[0, \pi]$, and the direction of $\bfn_0$ will be chosen to be
consistent with this choice in tune (it is left as an exercise for the reader to prove that there
will always be exactly one spin tune in the range $[0, \pi]$.

%-----------------------------------------------------------------   
\section{Linear \texorpdfstring{$\partial\bfn/\partial\delta$}{dn/dpz} Calculation}
\label{s:dn.calc}

When evaluating the equations in the previous section, in many situations it is sufficient to just
use the value of $\partial\bfn/\partial\delta$ as calculated in the linear regime. In the linear regime,
$\partial\bfn/\partial\delta$ is only dependent upon the $s$-position and is independent of the phase space
position. The calculation of $\partial\bfn/\partial\delta$ starts with the linearized transport equations which
are characterized by a $6\times6$ orbital 1-turn transfer matrix $\bfM$ along with the spin
transport which can be written in the form
\begin{equation}
  \bfq_s(\bfr) = \bfq_0 + \arrowbfq \dotproduct \bfr
  \label{qqqr}
\end{equation}
The quaternion map $\bfq_s$, evaluated at the orbital phase space point $\bfr$, has a zeroth order
part $\bfq_0$ (the spin rotation for a particle on the closed orbit) and the first order part
$\arrowbfq = (\bfq_1, \ldots, \bfq_6)$ which is a vector of six quaternions and which is
evaluated in \Eq{qqqr} by taking the dot product with the vector $\bfr$.

The closed orbit invariant spin $\bfn_0$ which has unit amplitude satisfies the equation
\begin{equation}
  \bfq_0 \, \bfn_0 \, \BAR\bfq_0 = \bfn_0
  \label{qnqn}
\end{equation}
The solution to this equation, normalized to one, is
\begin{equation}
  \bfn_0 = \frac{(q_{0,x}, q_{0,y}, q_{0,z})}{\|(q_{0,x}, q_{0,y}, q_{0,z})\|}
  \label{nkqqq}
\end{equation}
Another way of writing this is using \Eq{qt2ui}
\begin{equation}
  \bfq_0 = \cos(\pi \, \nu_0) + 
  (n_{0,x} \, \cali + n_{0,y} \, \calj + n_{0,z} \, \calk) \, \sin(\pi \, \nu_0)
  \label{qnni}
\end{equation}
where $\nu_0$ is the spin tune.

Since $\bfq_s$ is a rotation quaternion, the magnitude of $\bfq_s(\bfr)$ must remain one. Using
\Eq{qqqr} in \Eq{1qqq}, to keep the magnitude equal to one to linear order gives the condition
\begin{equation}
  \bfq_0 \dotproduct \bfq_j = 0, \qquad j = 1, \ldots, 6
  \label{qq0}
\end{equation}
for all $\bfq_j$ components of $\arrowbfq$.

To calculate $\partial\bfn/\partial\delta$, the first step is to compute the eigenvectors $\bfv_k$ and
eigenvalues $\lambda_k$, $k = 1, \ldots, 6$ of the 1-turn orbital matrix. The
corresponding spin eigenvectors $\bfn_k$ are computed from the equation
\begin{equation}
  \bfq_s(\bfv_k) \,\, (\bfn_0 + \bfn_k) \,\, \BAR\bfq_s(\bfv_k) = \bfn_0 + \lambda_k \, \bfn_k
  \label{qnnq}
\end{equation}
These eigenvectors are perpendicular to $\bfn_0$. This can be easily shown by noting that
$\bfn(\bfr)$ in \Eq{nrn0} must have unit magnitude to linear order for any arbitrary choice of
$A_k(\bfr)$. Using \Eqs{qqqr} and \eq{qnqn}, and keeping only linear terms gives
\begin{equation}
  \lambda_k \, \bfn_k - \bfq_0 \, \bfn_k \, \BAR\bfq_0 = 
  (\arrowbfq \dotproduct \bfv_k) \, \bfn_0 \, \BAR\bfq_0 + 
  \bfq_0 \, \bfn_0 \, (\BAR\arrowbfq \dotproduct \bfv_k)
  \label{lnqnq}
\end{equation}
This equation is linear in the unknown $\bfn_k$ and so may be solved using standard linear
algebra techniques. One small problem with \Eq{lnqnq} is that it is degenerate along the $\bfn_0$
axis in the limit when there is no RF voltage since the eigen mode associated with the longitudinal
motion will have an eigenvalue of one. In this case, round-off errors can cause large
inaccuracies. To get around this, \Eq{lnqnq} is projected onto the plane perpendicular to $\bfn_0$
by first constructing vectors $\bfc_1$ and $\bfc_2$ which are orthogonal to $\bfn_0$ and orthogonal
to each other. \Eq{lnqnq} is projected onto the $(\bfc_1, \bfc_2)$ plane to give
\begin{align}
  \big( \lambda_k \, \bfn_k - \bfq_0 \, \bfn_k \, \BAR\bfq_0 \big) \cdot \bfc_m = 
  \big( (\arrowbfq \dotproduct \bfv_k) \, \bfn_0 \, \BAR\bfq_0 + 
  \bfq_0 \, \bfn_0 \, (\BAR\arrowbfq \dotproduct \bfv_k) \big) \cdot \bfc_m,
  \quad m = 1, 2
  \label{lnqnq2}
\end{align}
Now using the fact that $\bfn_k$ is perpendicular to $\bfn_0$ means that $\bfn_k$ can be written as
a linear combination of $\bfc_1$ and $\bfc_2$
\begin{equation}
  \bfn_k = a_1 \, \bfc_1 + a_2 \, \bfc_2
\end{equation}
Using this in \Eq{lnqnq2} gives linear coupled equations in the unknowns $(a_1, a_2)$ which is easily solved.

Since the eigenvectors $\bfv_k$ span phase space, for any given phase space position $\bfr$, there
exist a set of coefficients $A_k(\bfr)$, $k = 1, \ldots, 6$, such that
\begin{equation}
  \bfr = \sum_{k = 1}^6 A_k(\bfr) \, \bfv_k
\end{equation}
Define the function $\bfn$ by
\begin{equation}
  \bfn(\bfr) \equiv \bfn_0 + \sum_{k = 1}^6 A_k(\bfr) \, \bfn_k
  \label{nrn0}
\end{equation}
This function obeys the T-BMT equation and is continuous and thus is the solution (up to a flip in
sign and a normalization constant) for the invariant spin field. From this, ${\partial
\bfn}/\partial \delta$, which is computed taking the derivative at constant $x$, $p_x$, $y$, $p_y$,
and $z$, is obtained via
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial \bfn}{\partial \delta} = 
  \sum_{k = 1}^6 A_k \, \bfn_k
  \label{ndan}
\end{equation}
with the $A_k$ being computed by inverting the equation
\begin{equation}
  (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1)^t = \sum_{k = 1}^6 A_k \, \bfv_k
  \label{000001}
\end{equation}
where the superscript $t$ means transpose. Notice that for ${\partial \bfn}/\partial \delta$, as
well as any other partial derivative, the component in the direction of $\bfn_0$ will be zero since,
to first order, the amplitude of $\bfn$ must be constant (since the equation for $\bfn$ is only
valid to first order, the computed amplitude will have non-zero higher order terms).

A problem arises if the machine that is being simulated does not have any RF cavities or the voltage
in the cavities is zero. In this case, there are no synchrotron oscillations which results in
degenerate eigenvectors and the eigenvectors will not span all of phase space. The solution here
is to reduce the dimensionality of phase space to five by removing the $z$ coordinate. The above
equations then can be used with the sums over $k$ ranging from 1 to 5. 

It is sometimes informative to compute the contribution of ${\partial \bfn}/\partial \delta$ due to
just one or two modes of oscillation. That is, to compute ${\partial \bfn}/\partial \delta$ with the sum in
\Eq{ndan} restricted to be over one or two corresponding eigen states that comprise the oscillation
modes of interest. This information can help guide lattice design.

Another way for analyzing where in the lattice contributions to $\partial\bfn/\partial\delta$ are
coming from is to consider the spin transport maps for individual elements. These maps will be of
the form given in \Eq{qqqr}. The contribution to $\partial\bfn/\partial\delta$ from an element is
due to the non-zero terms in $\arrowbfq = (\bfq_1, \ldots, \bfq_6)$. If terms are selectively
zeroed, and this significantly changes the polarization, this is a clue for designing a lattice. For
example, if setting $\bfq_1$ and $\bfq_2$ to zero for a set of elements in a certain region of the
machine leads to significantly greater polarizations, this indicates that the polarization is
sensitive to horizontal excitation in this region. Similarly, zeroing elements in $\bfq_3$ and
$\bfq_4$ is associated with vertical excitation and $\bfq_5$ and $\bfq_6$ is associated with
longitudinal excitation. With the slim formalism (\sref{s:slim}), the $2\times6$ matrix
$\bfG$ can be decomposed into three $2\times2$ sub-matrices:
\begin{equation}
  \bfG = \left( \bfG_x, \bfG_y, \bfG_z \right)
\end{equation}
Zeroing $\bfq_1$ and $\bfq_2$ is equivalent to zeroing $\bfG_x$, etc.

\section{Single Resonance Model}
\label{s:spin.res}

Resonances occur when the spin tune $\nu_s$ is an integer (``imperfection'' resonances) and when the spin
tune $\nu_s$ in combination with the three orbital tunes $\nu_x$, $\nu_y$, and $\nu_z$ is an integer
(``intrinsic'' or ``spin-orbit'' resonances)
\begin{equation}
  \nu_s + m_x \, \nu_x + m_y \, \nu_y + m_z \, \nu_z = m_0
\end{equation}
where $m_x$, $m_y$, $m_z$, and $m_0$ are integers. As discussed below, 
in the linear approximation (\sref{s:dn.calc}),
resonances only occur if one and exactly one of the $m_x$, $m_y$, or $m_z$ has a value of one and
the other two are zero.

Generally, in rings where the synchrotron radiation is large (think electrons), the depolarization
due to radiation will tend to dominate (\sref{s:spin.pol}). For rings where the synchrotron radiation is
small (think protons), resonances will be more important. Notice that synchrotron radiation, being a
stochastic process results in depolarization. Resonances, on the other hand, are not stochastic and
even if a resonance tilts the polarization direction there can be the possibility of recovery.

To calculate the effect of a resonance it is helpful to know the resonance strength.  The resonance
strength calculation can be motivated by considering the Single Resonance Model
(SRM)\cite{b:spin.hoff} where it is assumed that only one orbital mode is excited and that there is
a single dominating resonance. In this case the spin equation of motion is
\begin{equation}
  \frac{d \bfs}{d \theta} = \Bf\Omega \cross \bfs, \qquad 
  \Bf\Omega = \begin{pmatrix}
    \epsilon_r \, \cos \Phi \\
    \epsilon_r \, \sin \Phi \\
    \nu_0
  \end{pmatrix}
  \label{stos}
\end{equation}
where $\epsilon_r$ is the resonance strength, $\nu_0$ is the closed orbit spin tune and $\theta$ is
the longitudinal angle with $\theta = 2 \, \pi$ representing one turn in the circular accelerator.
In the above equation the phase $\Phi$ is related to the orbital mode tunes $Q$ via
\begin{equation}
  \Phi = (j_0 + j_x Q_x + j_y Q_y + j_z Q_z) \theta + \Phi_0 \equiv
  \kappa \theta + \Phi_0
\end{equation}
with $j_0$, $j_x$, $j_y$, and $j_z$ being integers and $\Phi_0$ being the starting phase. \Eq{stos}
defines $\kappa$. \Eq{stos} can be solved by transforming to a coordinate system rotating about the
$z$-axis with a rotational frequency $\kappa$. This is called the ``\vn{resonance}'' coordinate
system or the ``\vn{rotating}'' coordinate system. In this frame, the spin vector $s_R$ is
\begin{equation}
  \bfs_R = \bfq_z(-\Phi/2) \,\, \bfs \,\, \BAR\bfq_z(-\Phi/2) \\
  \label{rqsq}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
  \bfq_z(\phi) \equiv \big( \cos (\phi/2) +  \sin (\phi/2) \big) \, \calk
\end{equation}

Using \Eq{rqsq} in \Eq{stos} gives
\begin{equation}
  \frac{d \bfs_R}{d \theta} = \Bf\Omega_R \cross \bfs_R, \qquad
  \Bf\Omega_R = \begin{pmatrix}
    \epsilon_r \\
    0 \\
    \delta 
  \end{pmatrix},
  \qquad
  \delta = \nu_0 - \kappa
  \label{stos2}
\end{equation}
Spins rotate around around $\Bf\Omega_R$. A spin initially aligned along the $z$-axis will be 
tilted a maximum of $\tan^{-1}(2\epsilon_r/\delta)$ away from the $z$-axis. This shows that the
characteristic frequency width of the resonance is set by $\delta \approx \epsilon_r$. That is,
the frequency width scales linearly with $\epsilon_r$.

In the rotating coordinate system, a spin oriented parallel to $\Bf\Omega_R$ remains parallel to
$\Bf\Omega_R$ so $\Bf\Omega_R$ is in the direction of the invariant spin field. Transforming back
to the laboratory frame and normalizing to one, $\bfn$ is
\begin{equation}
  \bfn (\Phi) = \frac{\sign(\delta)}{\Lambda} \, 
  \begin{pmatrix}
    \epsilon_r \, \cos \Phi \\
    \epsilon_r \, \sin \Phi \\
    \delta
  \end{pmatrix},
  \qquad
  \Lambda = \sqrt{\delta^2 + \epsilon_r^2}
  \label{nsdl}
\end{equation}
where the sign factor $\sign(\delta)$ is chosen so that on the closed orbit with $\epsilon_r = 0$
the $\bfn$ axis is in the positive $z$-direction.

\Eq{nsdl} shows that resonance occurs when $\delta = 0$ or $\nu_0 = \kappa$.  The use of a
sinusoidal perturbation in the single resonance model results in the suppression of all other
resonances.  In an actual machine, the presence of a perturbation at some specific point in the
machine will produce a comb of resonances of the form $m_0 \pm Q$.

At resonance, with $\delta = 0$, \Eq{stos2} shows that if a spin in the resonance coordinate system
is initially aligned along the $\bfn_0$ axis ($\bfs_R = (0, 0, 1)$), After $N$ turns, in the linear
approximation, the spin will be
\begin{equation}
  \bfs_R(N,\bfn_0) = (0, -N \cdot 2 \, \pi \, \epsilon_r, 1)
  \label{sr0n}
\end{equation}
\Eq{sr0n} gives a physical interpretation to the resonance strength $\epsilon_r$. The resonance
strength is the angle (modulo $2 \, \pi$) that a spin is tipped away from $\bfn_0$ in one turn. The
linear approximation will be valid for $N$ such that $N \, \epsilon_r \ll 1$. For the linear
approximation to be valid for any positive $N$, $\epsilon_r$ must satisfy $\epsilon_r \ll 1$.

%-----------------------------------------------------------------   
\section{Linear Resonance Analysis}
\label{s:spin.res1}

Within the linear approximation, the resonance strength $\epsilon_r$ (\Eq{stos}) can be related to
the first order spin transport (\Eq{qqqr}). The analysis starts by inversion of \Eq{sr0n} and
letting $N$ go to infinity
\begin{equation}
  \epsilon_r = \lim_{N \rightarrow \infty} \, \frac{1}{2 \, \pi \, N} \, 
  \left| \bfs_R(N,\bfn_0) - \bfn_0 \right|
  \label{eN12n}
\end{equation}
Here the restriction $N \ll 1 / \epsilon_r$ can be ignored since the analysis below will use the
linearized spin transport and it is the nonlinear terms in the spin transport which makes the
restriction necessary. In fact, with linear spin transport, the magnitude of $\bfs_R$ is not
constant and at resonance is unbounded. \Eq{eN12n} will still be valid even when there are multiple
resonances present since \Eq{eN12n} must be evaluated on a particular resonance and, it will be
seen, the contribution to \Eq{eN12n} from non-resonant resonances is zero.

$\bfs_R(N, \bfn_0)$ is the spin after $N$ turns given an initial spin of $\bfn_0$.  $\bfs_R(N,
\bfn_0)$ can be computed via
\begin{equation}
  \bfs_R(N, \bfn_0) = \bfQ_N \, \bfn_0 \, \BAR\bfQ_N
  \label{sQnQ}
\end{equation}
The rotation quaternion $\bfQ_N$ over $N$ turns is the product of one-turn rotation quaternions $\bfq_s(\bfr)$
with an extra factor of $\bfq_0^{-N}$ to convert from laboratory coordinates to resonance coordinates since
$\bfq_s$ is the transport in laboratory coordinates (by definition, resonance coordinates are the same as 
laboratory coordinates at $N = 0$).
\begin{equation}
  \bfQ_N = \bfq_0^{-N} \, \bfq_s(\bfr_{N-1}) \ldots \bfq_s(\bfr_1) \, \bfq_s(\bfr_0)
  \label{Qqqr}
\end{equation}
In the above equation, $\bfr_j$ is the orbital position after $j$ turns. 
Using \Eq{qqqr} and expanding to linear order in $\arrowbfq$ gives
\begin{equation}
  \bfQ_N = \bfq_0^{-1} \, \left( 
  \bfq_0 + \sum_{j = 0}^{N-1} \, \bfq_0^{-j}
  \left( \arrowbfq \cdot \bfr_j \right) \bfq_0^{j}
  \right)
  \label{qqqjn}
\end{equation}
Using this with \Eq{sQnQ} in \Eq{eN12n} and keeping only linear terms, gives
\begin{equation}
  \epsilon_r = \left|
    \bfq_0^{-1} \, \bfZ \, \bfn_0 + 
    \bfn_0 \, \BAR\bfZ \, \bfq_0
    \right| \label{eqZnn}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
  \bfZ = \lim_{N \rightarrow \infty} 
  \frac{1}{2 \pi N} 
  \sum_{j = 0}^{N-1} \, \bfq_0^{-j} \left( \arrowbfq \cdot \bfr_j \right) \bfq_0^{j}
  \label{Z}
\end{equation}
To evaluate $\bfZ$, the quantity $\bfq_0^j$ is decomposed into two parts using the fact that $\kappa
= \nu_0 + \delta$
\begin{equation}
  \bfq_0^j = e^{ i \pi j (\nu_0 + \delta) + i \Phi_0} \, \bfn_0^\mmin + 
             e^{-i \pi j (\nu_0 + \delta) - i \phi_0} \, \bfn_0^\ppls
  \label{q12en}
\end{equation}
where $\bfn_0^\mmin \equiv I_-(\bfn_0)$ and $\bfn_0^\ppls \equiv I_+(\bfn_0)$ are
given by \Eq{n1in}.

For a particular mode $k$ of oscillation, $\bfr_j$ is given by \Eq{x2jv}. The end result will be
independent of $\phi_0$ in \Eq{x2jv} so without loss of generality, $\Phi_0$ will be set to zero.
Using this along with the above equations gives
\begin{align}
  \bfZ = \lim_{N \rightarrow \infty} 
    \frac{\sqrt{J}}{2 \pi N} 
    \sum_{j = 0}^{N-1} \Big[
    &\bfn_0^\ppls (\arrowbfq \cdot \bfv_k)   \bfn_0^\mmin \, e^{ i2\pi j (Q_k + \nu_0 + \delta)} + 
     \bfn_0^\mmin (\arrowbfq \cdot \bfv_k^*) \bfn_0^\ppls \, e^{-i2\pi j (Q_k + \nu_0 + \delta)} + {} 
    \nonumber \\[-2ex]
    &\bfn_0^\mmin (\arrowbfq \cdot \bfv_k)   \bfn_0^\ppls \, e^{ i2\pi j (Q_k - \nu_0 - \delta)} +
     \bfn_0^\ppls (\arrowbfq \cdot \bfv_k^*) \bfn_0^\mmin \, e^{-i2\pi j (Q_k - \nu_0 - \delta)} + {}
    \label{zj2pn} \\
    &\bfn_0^\mmin (\arrowbfq \cdot \bfv_k)   \bfn_0^\mmin \, e^{i2\pi j Q_k} + 
     \bfn_0^\ppls (\arrowbfq \cdot \bfv_k^*) \bfn_0^\ppls \, e^{-i2\pi j Q_k} + \CRNO
    &\bfn_0^\ppls (\arrowbfq \cdot \bfv_k)   \bfn_0^\ppls \, e^{i2\pi j Q_k} + 
     \bfn_0^\mmin (\arrowbfq \cdot \bfv_k^*) \bfn_0^\mmin \, e^{-i2\pi j Q_k}
   \Big] \nonumber
\end{align}
At a resonance, $\delta = 0$. 
The first two terms on the right hand side of \Eq{zj2pn} will be nonzero only at the sum resonance
with $Q_k + \nu_0 = p$ for $p$ an integer.  The third and fourth terms will be nonzero only at the
difference resonance with $Q_k - \nu_0 = p$.  And the last four terms will be nonzero only at an
integer resonance where $Q_k = p$ which can be ignored since an accelerator can never be operated
stably at an integer tune.

The normalized resonance strength $\xi_r$ is defined by
\begin{equation}
  \epsilon_r \equiv \sqrt{J} \, \xi_r
  \label{ejx}
\end{equation}
Combining the above equations along with \Eqs{n6} through \eq{4ggg}, the strength of the sum
resonance for the $k$ mode of oscillation is
\begin{equation}
  \xi_{r+} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2\pi} \big| \bf{\cal G} \cdot \bfv_k \big| 
  \label{x12pq1}
\end{equation}
and for the difference resonance the strength is
\begin{equation}
  \xi_{r-} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2\pi} \big|
  \bf{\cal G} \cdot \bfv_k^* \big| 
  \label{x12pq2}
\end{equation}
where $\bf{\cal G}$ is given by
\begin{equation}
  \bf{\cal G} = 2 \, \bfn_0^\ppls \arrowbfq \bfn_0^\mmin
  \label{g2nqn}
\end{equation}
It should be noted that sum resonances are not physically ``distinct'' from difference
resonances. That is, sum resonances become difference resonances and vice versa if the sign of
$\bfn$ and $\nu$ are flipped in the analysis (remember that if $\bfn$ is a valid spin field then so
is $-\bfn$).

The resonance strength can also be calculated within the \vn{SLIM} formalism (\sref{s:slim}) via
\Eq{x1pg} or \Eq{x2pg}. Comparing \Eqs{x12pq1} or \eq{x12pq2} with \Eq{x2pg} it is seen
that $\bf{\cal G}$ is the quaternion equivalent of the SLIM $\bfG$ $2\cross6$ matrix.

\section{SLIM Formalism}
\label{s:slim}

The \vn{SLIM} formalism\footnote
  {
The name references an early computer program that implemented the formalism.
  }
\cite{b:chao.spin,b:barber99}, introduced by Alex Chao, is a way to represent the linearized (that
is, first order) orbital and spin transport as an $8 \cross 8$ matrix which then can be analyzed
using standard linear algebra techniques. The idea is to expand the transport map around the closed
orbit $(\bfr_0, \bfn_0)$ where $\bfr_0$ is the orbital closed orbit and $\bfn_0$ is the ``spin
closed orbit''. Namely the unit-vector, one-turn periodic solution of the Thomas-BMT equation on
$\bfr_0$\footnote
  {
Warning: The symbol $\hat n$ or
$\vec n$ used in \cite{b:chao.spin,b:barber85} and other early literature to denote the periodic
solution of the T--BMT equation on the closed orbit should be replaced by the symbol $\hat n_0$ to
conform to the modern convention \cite{b:barber99} and thereby avoid confusion with the symbol $\hat
n$ which denotes the invariant spin field.  In addition, the symbols $\vec m$ and $\vec l$
appearing, for example, in the formulae for the matrix $\bfG$ in \cite{b:barber85}, should be
replaced by the symbols $\hat m_0$ and $\hat l_0$, namely by the modern symbols for the two
(normally) non-periodic solutions of the T-BMT equation, which together with $\hat n_0$, form an
orthonormal coordinate system.
  }.

$\bfn_0$ is just the invariant spin field on the closed orbit. The formalism provides estimates of
the equilibrium spin polarization and the rate of depolarization in electron storage rings, both
under the restriction of the aforementioned linearization. Moreover, a procedure known as
spin-matching, for minimizing depolarization driven by the noise injected into synchro-betatron
motion by synchrotron radiation, and which involves optimizing the layout of the ring, can be
executed in a simple and elegant way via the SLIM formalism. The formalism can also give insights
into proton spin dynamics in regimes where the linearization approximation suffices.

The \vn{SLIM} formalism expresses spin components using two right-hand coordinate systems:
\footnote{Different authors will use different conventions for the ordering of the axes
The ordering used here puts $\bfn_0$ second reflecting the fact that in many rings the $\bfn_0$
axis will point in the vertical $y$-direction in the arcs.}
\begin{align}
  &\big( \bfl(s), \bfn_0(s), \bfm(s) \big)
  \qquad \text{and} \qquad \CRNO
  &\big( \bfl_0(s), \bfn_0(s), \bfm_0(s) \big)
\end{align}
The axes $\bfl_0(s)$ and $\bfm_0(s)$ are solutions of the Thomas-BMT equation on the closed orbit
and, generally, are not one-turn periodic. The axes $\bfl(s)$ and $\bfm(s)$ are chosen to be
one-turn periodic but can have an arbitrary $s$ dependence which can be chosen for convenience
otherwise. The axes $\bfl_0(s)$ and $\bfm_0(s)$ are used for spin-matching and $\bfl(s)$ and
$\bfm(s)$ are used for calculating polarization and depolarization.  With respect to these axes, a
unit-length spin $\bfS$ can be written as
\begin{align}
  \bfS &= \sqrt{1- \alpha_0^2 - \beta_0^2} ~\bfn_0 + \alpha_0 \, \bfl_0 + \beta_0 \, \bfm_0 
  \qquad \text{or} \qquad \CRNO
  \bfS &= \sqrt{1- \alpha^2 - \beta^2} ~\bfn_0 + \alpha \, \bfl + \beta \, \bfm
  \label{s1ab}
\end{align}

To linearize the transport, it is assumed that $\alpha_0$, and $\beta_0$ (and hence $\alpha$ and
$\beta$) are small compared to one. To first order, the variation from unity of the spin component
along the $\bfn_0$ axis will be second order and can be ignored:
\begin{align}
  \bfS &\approx \bfn_0 + \alpha_0 \, \bfl_0 + \beta_0 \, \bfm_0
  \qquad \text{or} \qquad \CRNO
  \bfS &\approx \bfn_0 + \alpha \, \bfl + \beta \, \bfm
\end{align}

The $\bfn_0$ coordinate is dropped since the spin component along $\bfn_0$ is a constant. With this,
the eight-dimensional spin-orbit phase space used in the SLIM formalism is
\begin{align}
  &(x, p_x, y, p_y, z, p_z, \alpha_0, \beta_0)
  \qquad \text{or} \qquad \CRNO
  &(x, p_x, y, p_y, z, p_z, \alpha, \beta)
  \label{xpxypy}
\end{align}
where the orbital part $x, p_x$, etc. is taken with respect to the closed orbit. 

The first order map between two any points $s_1$ and $s_2$ is an $8 \cross 8$ matrix $\wt\bfM$ which
is written in the form
\begin{equation}
  \wt\bfM(s1, s2) = \begin{pmatrix}
    \bfM_{6\cross6} & \Bf 0_{6\cross2} \\
    \bfG_{2\cross6} & \bfD_{2\cross2}
  \end{pmatrix}
  \label{mm0gd}
\end{equation}
where $\bfM(s_1, s_2)$ is the $6\cross6$ orbital phase space transport matrix, and $\bfG(s_1, s_2)$
contains the coupling of the spin coordinates $(\alpha_0, \beta_0)$ or $(\alpha, \beta)$ to the
orbital motion. The upper right block $\Bf 0_{6\cross2}$ in the $\wt\bfM$ matrix is zero since
Stern-Gerlach effects are ignored. When $\bfG$ is calculated with respect to the $(\bfl_0, \bfm_0)$
axes, large spin precessions on the closed orbit due to dipole and solenoid fields are
eliminated. That leaves small precessions due to synchro-betatron motion. The $\bfG$ matrix then
represents the dominating linear dependence of the small precessions on the six synchro-betatron
coordinates and it then provides a good framework for analysis \cite{b:barber85,b:barber99}. In
\Eq{mm0gd}, $\bfD$ is a $2\cross2$ rotation matrix for the spin transport of a particle on the
closed orbit. In this case, since the $\bfl_0(s)$ and $\bfm_0(s)$ are solutions to the T-BMT
equation, $\bfD$ is the unit matrix.

To compute $\widetilde\bfM$ for a section of the ring, the first step is to find the $6 \times 6$
orbital matrix for the section. To calculate $\bfn_0$, $\bfl_0$ and $\bfm_0$, first $\bfn_0$ at some
starting point $s$ is calculated (section 18.3) and propagated around the ring. This $\bfn_0$ is
then available for calculations involving the whole ring. If only part of the ring is being
analyzed, the orientation of $\bfn_0$ at the start of the section can be an input parameter. That
is, it can be given by the User and not calculated. However, for spin-matching, it usually only
makes physical sense to use the $\bfn_0$ at the start of the section that corresponds to the
$\bfn_0$ calculated for the whole ring. After $\bfn_0$ is known at some $s$-position, $\bfl_0$ and
$\bfm_0$ at that $s$-position can be chosen somewhat arbitrarily to form the right handed coordinate
system. Sometimes it is possible to make a special choice of the initial $\bfl_0$ and $\bfm_0$ in
order to simplify the $\bfG$ matrices. For example, in a section where there are only drifts and
quadrupoles so that there is no spin rotation for a particle traveling on the centerline, with
$\bfn_0$ pointing vertically, a choice of $\bfm_0$ pointing in the longitudinal $s$-direction results
in the first line of the $\bfG$ matrix for the section being zero. After the initial $\bfl_0$ and
$\bfm_0$ axes have been specified at some initial $s$, the axes can be transported along the closed
orbit of the section.

If the one-turn $\bfG$ were zero everywhere, the spin motion would be completely decoupled from the
orbital motion (at least to first order) and the depolarization rate $\tau_{dep}^{-1}$ given by
\Eq{tdep} would be zero since $\partial\bfn / \partial\delta$ would be zero. Therefore,
spin-matching analysis for a section of the ring involves adjusting the parameters (quadrupole
strengths, drift lengths etc) of the section so as to minimize elements in appropriate columns of
the $\bfG$ matrix. This decreases the rate of depolarization by minimizing
$\partial\bfn/\partial\delta$ at the dipole magnets (where $g$ in \Eq{tdep} is nonzero)
\cite{b:barber99}. Such adjustments are made while simultaneously maintaining acceptable
Courant-Snyder parameters and for this the closed orbit should be taken to be the design orbit.
This optimization can be carried out using standard facilities in \bmad. The calculation of
$\partial\bfn/\partial\delta$ in the SLIM approximation is described below.

The process for calculating electron polarization and the rate of depolarization in the \vn{SLIM}
formalism is as follows. First, the $8 \times 8$ matrix $\widetilde\bfM$ for one-turn is calculated
as described above. After this, using the closed-orbit spin tune $\nu_0$, a specific version of
$(\bfl, \bfm)$ is constructed by rotating the vectors $\bfl_0$ and $\bfm_0$ backwards around
$\bfn_0$ by the angle $2\pi \nu_0$ in a drift space right at the end of the turn, thereby
transforming $\alpha_0$ and $\beta_0$ into $\alpha$ and $\beta$ and transforming the $\bfG$ matrix
correspondingly\footnote{Adding a rotation at the end is just for convenience. For some other
applications it is useful to choose axes $\bfl$ and $\bfm$ with respect to which spins precess at
the constant rate with a phase advance of $2\pi \nu_0$ per turn.}. The original one-turn $\bfG$
matrix is not one-turn periodic but the transformed $\bfG$ matrix is one-turn periodic and the
matrix $\bfD$ for one-turn becomes the $2 \times 2$ rotation matrix with rotation angle $2\pi \nu_0$
\cite{b:chao.spin}. The new matrix $\widetilde \bfM$ is then also one-turn periodic and its
eigenvectors are used as described after \Eq{qvw} for calculating the derivative ${\partial
\bfn}/\partial \delta$ used in \Eq{tdep}. Note that if the elements in the appropriate columns of
the non-periodic $\bfG$ matrix for the one-turn map at a dipole have been minimized by
spin-matching, the corresponding elements of the periodic one-turn $\bfG$ matrix have been minimized
too. As a consequence it can be seen, via \Eqs{wdlgv} and \eq{ndaw}, that
$\partial\bfn/\partial\delta$ has been minimized as required.

In contrast to the approach in \cite{b:barber85,b:barber99}, \bmad calculates the $\bfG$ and $\bfD$
matrices from the quaternion of the spin transport map (which \bmad calculates via PTC
(\sref{c:ptc.use})). After the $(\bfl_0, \bfn_0, \bfm_0)$ coordinates have been calculated (or set by
the User) at some initial point, the spin axes can be transported using the $\bfq_0$ quaternion
(\Eq{qqqr}). When analyzing only a section of a ring, there is no identifiable spin tune so nothing
further needs to be done. In this case, the $\bfD$ matrix is just a unit matrix. When analyzing
one-turn maps, if the $\bfl$ and $\bfm$ axes are set to be the $\bfl_0(s)$ and $\bfm_0(s)$ axes
except at the end of the lattice, the spin phase advance as a function of $s$ will be zero except
just before the starting position where there will be a discontinuous jump in phase.

Once the $(\bfl_0, \bfn_0, \bfm_0)$ axes have been calculated, the matrices $\bfG$ and $\bfD$ can be
calculated from the spin transport map (which \bmad calculates via PTC (\sref{c:ptc.use})).  The
first order transport map \Eq{qqqr} is used. Let $\bfq_{lnm}(s)$ be the quaternion that transforms
from $(\bfl_0, \bfn_0, \bfm_0)$\footnote{ Such a formalism works also with the $(\bfl, \bfn_0,
\bfm)$} coordinates to $(x, y, z)$ coordinates at a given point $s$. With this, the spin transport
$\what\bfq$ from $s_1$ to $s_2$ in the $(\bfl_0, \bfn_0, \bfm_0)$ coordinate system is
\begin{equation}
  \what\bfq_s(s_1, s_2) = \bfq_{lnm}(s_2) \, \bfq_s(s_1, s_2) \, \bfq_{lnm}^{-1}(s_1)
\end{equation}
The zeroth order part of $\bfq_s$ gives:
\begin{equation}
  \what\bfq_0(s_1,s_2) = \bfq_{lnm}(s_2) \, \bfq_0(s_1, s_2) \, \bfq_{lnm}^{-1}(s_1) 
\end{equation}
represents a rotation around the $\bfn_0$ axis. 

To calculate the $\bfD$ matrix, $\what\bfq_0$ is converted into a $3 \times 3$ rotation matrix
$\bfR_0$ via \Eq{rqqq}). The second row and second column of this rotation matrix corresponds to the
$\bfn_0$ axis. Since the component of the spin along this axis does not vary to first order,
$\bfR_0$ has the form
\begin{equation}
  \Bf R_0 = \begin{pmatrix}
      R_0(1,1) & 0 & R_0(1,3) \\
      0        & 1 & 0        \\
      R_0(3,1) & 0 & R_0(3,3)
  \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
That is, the rotation is around the $\bfn_0$ axis. Since the $\bfn_0$ spin component is ignored in
the SLIM formalism (\Eq{xpxypy}), the $2 \times 2$ $\Bf D$ matrix is simply $\bfR_0$ with the second
row and second column removed.
\begin{equation}
  \Bf D(s_1, s_2) = \begin{pmatrix}
      R_0(1,1) & R_0(1,3) \\
      R_0(3,1) & R_0(3,3)
  \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
In particular, when using the $(\bfl_0, \bfn_0, \bfm_0)$ coordinate system, $\widehat \bfq_0$
represents the identity ($\equiv (1, 0, 0, 0)$) and $\bfD$ is a unit matrix as expected.

The rows of the $\bfG$ matrix encode the first-order dependence of the changes of the angles
$\alpha_0$ and $\beta_0$ (or of the angles $\alpha$ and $\beta$).  The $\bfG$ matrix can therefore
be calculated from $\what\bfq_i$ which is the first order part of $\what\bfq_s$
\begin{equation}
  \what\bfq_i = \bfq_{lnm}(s_2) \, \bfq_i(s_1, s_2) \, \bfq_{lnm}^{-1}(s_1)
\end{equation}
Using \Eq{qqqr} in \Eq{rqqq} and keeping only first order terms gives
\begin{align}
  \bfG(1,i) &= 2 (\what q_{0,y} \, \what q_{i,x} - \what q_{0,0} \, \what q_{i,z}) 
  \label{g2qqqq} \\
  \bfG(2,i) &= 2 (\what q_{0,0} \, \what q_{i,x} + \what q_{0,y} \, \what q_{i,z}),
  \quad i = 1, \ldots, 6
  \nonumber
\end{align}
where the fact that $\what q_{0,x} = \what q_{0,z} = 0$ has been used.\footnote
  {
Do not be confused by the $x$, $y$ and $z$ subscripts which refer to the components of $\what q$
as defined in \Eq{qqqqq}. $\what q$ rotates spins in the $(\bfl_0, \bfn_0, \bfm_0)$ coordinate system.
Not the $(x, y, z)$ coordinate system.
  }
\footnote
  {
Unlike the operation of going from the linearized quaternion transport (\Eq{qqqr} to the
$\widetilde\bfM$ matrix, given an $\widetilde\bfM$ matrix, it is not possible to uniquely construct
the $\what\bfq_i$ quaternions. $\what q_{i,x}$ and $\what q_{i,z}$ can be determined by
\Eq{g2qqqq}. However, $\what q_{i,0}$ and $\what q_{i,y}$ can only be determined via \Eq{qnqn} up
to an unknown factor $\kappa$:
\begin{equation}
  \what q_{i,0} = \kappa \, \what q_{0,y}, \qquad \what q_{i,y} = -\kappa \, \what q_{0,0}
\end{equation}
A finite $\kappa$ represents a variation of the spin tune with a particle's orbital phase space
position. This is, a finite $q_{i,0}$ and $q_{i,y}$ represent a non-linear effect which will average
to zero over many turns as a particle with constant orbital amplitude samples different points on
the phase space torus it is on.
  }

The calculation of the derivative ${\partial\bfn}/\partial\delta$ within the SLIM formalism is
similar to the calculation using quaternions (\sref{s:dn.calc}). The following follows
Barber\cite{b:barber99}. The calculation starts with the one-turn periodic $8 \times 8$ matrix
$\widetilde \bfM$ [Here the periodic $(\bfl(s), \bfn_0(s), \bfm(s))$ coordinate system must be used
since the ending coordinates for $\bfM$ must be the same as the starting coordinates.]  The
eigenvectors $\bfu_k$ and eigenvalues $\lambda_k$ ($k = 1, \ldots 8$) of $\widetilde \bfM$ are of
the form
\begin{align}
  \bfu_k &= \begin{pmatrix} \bfv_k \\ \bfw_k \end{pmatrix}, \quad k = 1, \ldots, 6
  \label{qvw} \\
  \bfu_k &= \begin{pmatrix} \Bf 0_6 \\ \bfw_k \end{pmatrix}, \quad k = 7, 8 \nonumber
\end{align}
where $\bfv_k$ are eigenvectors of the orbital submatrix $\bfM$, and for the first six eigenvectors
the $\bfw_k$ are computed via (compare with \Eqs{lnqnq})
\begin{equation}
  \bfw_k = \left[ \lambda_k \, \bfI_2 - \bfD \right]^{-1} \bfG \, \bfv_k, \quad k = 1, \ldots, 6
  \label{wdlgv}
\end{equation}
where $\bfI_2$ is the $2 \times 2$ unit matrix. These eigenvectors, computed at the chosen starting
point $s1$ and are then propagated to other $s$-positions $s2$ using ${\widetilde \bfM}(s1, s2)$.

The derivative ${\partial \bfn}/\partial \delta$ is computed analogously to \Eq{ndaw}
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial \bfn}{\partial \delta} = 
  \left( \frac{\partial \alpha}{\partial \delta}, \, \frac{\partial \beta}{\partial \delta} \right) = 
  \sum_{k = 1}^6 A_k \, \bfw_k
  \label{ndaw}
\end{equation}
with the $A_k$ being computed from \Eq{000001}.

Alternatively, Chao \cite{b:chao79} gives a an analytical formulation where the eigenvectors are
normalized in the form \Eq{vsvi0}.  With this, ${\partial \bfn}/{\partial \delta}$ is computed via
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial \bfn}{\partial \delta} = i \, \sum_{k = 1}^6 \bfv_{k5}^* \, \bfw_k
  \label{ndivw}
\end{equation}

The strength of linear resonances can be calculated from the $\bfG$ matrix.  The corresponding
equation to \Eqs{x12pq1} and \eq{x12pq2} is\cite{b:spin.hoff}
\begin{equation}
  \xi_r = \frac{1}{2 \, \pi} \, \big| \overrightarrow\bfG \cdot \bfv_k \big|
  \label{x1pg}
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{equation}
  \overrightarrow\bfG = \bfG(1,:) + i \, \bfG(2,:)
\end{equation}
with $\bfG(1,:)$ being the first row of the $2\times6$ $\bfG$ matrix and $\bfG(2,:)$ being
the second row. It can be shown that an equivalent way of writing \Eq{x1pg} is 
\begin{equation}
  \xi_r = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2 \, \pi} \, \big| (\bfG(1,:) \cdot \bfv_k, \bfG(2,:) \cdot \bfv_k) \big|
  \label{x2pg}
\end{equation}

\section{Spinor Notation}

The following describes the old spinor representation formally used by \bmad to represent
spins. This documentation is kept as an aid for comparison with the spin tracking literature.

In the SU(2) representation, a spin $\Bf S$ is written as a spinor $\Psi = \left( \psi_{1}, \psi_{2}
\right)^{T}$ where $\psi_{1,2}$ are complex numbers. The conversion between SU(2) and SO(3) is
\begin{equation}  
  \Bf S = \Psi^{\dagger} \Bf {\bfsig} \, \Psi 
  \qquad \longleftrightarrow \qquad
  \Psi  = \frac{e^{i \xi}}{\sqrt{2 \left(1+s_{3}\right)}}   
     \begin{pmatrix} 1+s_{3} \\ s_{1}+i s_{2} \end{pmatrix}   
\end{equation}  
Where $\xi$ is an unmeasurable phase factor, and ${\bfsig} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)$ are
the three Pauli matrices
\begin{equation}
  \sigma_x = \begin{pmatrix} 0 &  1 \\ 1 &  0 \end{pmatrix}, \qquad
  \sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i &  0 \end{pmatrix}, \qquad
  \sigma_z = \begin{pmatrix} 1 &  0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
In polar coordinates
\begin{equation}   
  \Psi = \begin{pmatrix} \psi_{1} \\ \psi_{2} \end{pmatrix}
       = e^{i \xi}
         \begin{pmatrix} 
            \cos \frac{\theta}{2} \\   
            e^{i \phi} \, \sin \frac{\theta}{2}
         \end{pmatrix}
  \qquad \longleftrightarrow \qquad
  \Bf S = \begin{pmatrix} \sin \theta \cos \phi \\   
                          \sin \theta \sin \phi \\   
                          \cos \theta \end{pmatrix}
  \label{pp1p2}
\end{equation}
Due to the unitarity of the spin vector,   
$|\psi_{1}|^{2} + |\psi_{2}|^{2} = 1$.
The spinor eigenvectors along the $x$, $y$ and $z$ axes are
\begin{align}
   \Psi_{x+} &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \, \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \, , 
  &\Psi_{x-} &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \, \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \, , \CRNO
   \Psi_{y+} &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \, \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ i \end{pmatrix} \, , 
  &\Psi_{y-} &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \, \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -i \end{pmatrix} \, , \\
   \Psi_{z+} &=                       \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} \, , 
  &\Psi_{z-} &=                       \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix} \, . \nonumber
\end{align}

In spinor notation, the T-BMT equation can be written as
  \begin{equation}   
    \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t} \Psi = - \frac{i}{2} \left( \bfsig \dotproduct   
    {\pmb\Omega} \right) \Psi = -\frac{i}{2} \begin{pmatrix}
    \Omega_z & \Omega_x - i \, \Omega_y \\
    \Omega_x + i \, \Omega_y & -\Omega_z \end{pmatrix}
    \Psi
  \end{equation}
The solution over a time interval $\Delta t$, assuming constant $\pmb\Omega$, leads to a rotation of
the spin vector by an angle $\alpha = |\pmb\Omega| \, \Delta t$ around a unit vector $\bfhat a$
pointing in the same direction as $\pmb\Omega$
  \begin{align}   
    \Psi_f &= \exp \left[ -i \frac{\alpha}{2} \bfhat a \dotproduct \bfsig \right] \Psi_i \CRNO
         &= \left[ \cos \left( \frac{\alpha}{2} \right) \, \Bf I_{2} - 
            i \, (\bfhat a \dotproduct \bfsig) \, \sin \left( \frac{\alpha}{2} \right) \right] \Psi_i \\
         &= \Bf A \Psi_i. \nonumber
  \end{align}   
where $\Psi_i$ is the initial spin state, $\Psi_f$ is the final spin state, and $\Bf A$, describes
the spin transport. The Pauli matrices constitute a 2x2 Hermitian-matrix representation of the
quaternion components $\cali$, $\calj$, and $\calk$ in \Eq{qqqqq} and $\Bf A$ is the SU(2) matrix
representation of the quaternion $(a_0, \Bf a) = (\cos(\alpha/2), -\sin(\alpha/2) \, \bfhat
a)$. $\Bf A$ has the normalization condition $a_{0}^{2} + \boldsymbol{a}^{2} = 1$.

With spinors, the matrix representation of the observable $S_{\Bf u}$
corresponding to the measurement of the spin along the unit vector
$\Bf u$ is
\begin{align}
  S_{\Bf u} &\equiv \frac{\hbar}{2} \, \bfsig \dotproduct \Bf u \\   
            &= \frac{\hbar}{2} 
                   \begin{pmatrix} 
                     u_z            & u_x - i \, u_y \\
                     u_x + i \, u_y & u_z
                   \end{pmatrix}
\end{align}
The expectation value of this operator, $\Psi^\dagger \, \Bf S_u \, \Psi$, representing the spin of
a particle, satisfies the equation of motion of a classical spin vector in the particle's
instantaneous rest frame.

For a distribution of spins, the polarization $P_s$ along the unit
vector $\Bf u$ is defined as the absolute value of the average
expectation value of the spin over all N particles times
$\frac{2}{\hbar}$,
  \begin{equation}
    P_s = \frac{2}{\hbar} \frac{1}{N} \sum_{k=1}^{N} \Psi_k^\dagger S_{\Bf u} \Psi_k
  \end{equation}  

See \S~\sref{s:spin.hard.fringe} for formulas for tracking a spin through a multipole
fringe field.
