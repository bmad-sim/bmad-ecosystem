! Subroutine deallocate_ele_pointers (ele, nullify_only, nullify_branch, dealloc_poles)
!
! Subroutine to deallocate the pointers in an element.
!
! Note: ele%branch is always nullified. 
!
! Note: For Taylor elements that are slice_slaves: The ele%taylor(:)%term pointers are nullified and 
! not deallocated since these pointers always just point to the lord's corresponding components.
!
! Input:
!   ele            -- ele_struct: Element with pointers.
!   nullify_only   -- Logical, optional: If present and True: Nullify & do not deallocate.
!   nullify_branch -- Logical, optional: Nullify ele%branch? Default is True.
!   dealloc_poles  -- Logical, optional: Dealloc ele%a/b_pole, ele%a/b_pole_elec? Default is True.
!
! Output:
!   ele -- Ele_struct: Element with deallocated pointers.
