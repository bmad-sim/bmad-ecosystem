**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.
Using text which can be copied and pasted is preferable to  screenshots to help explain your problem.

**Minimal Working Example**
Try to provide a minimal working example. Of particular importance is the time it takes for the bug
to appear from the start of running of any program. This is important since debugging often involves running a program multiple times and so computation time can add up especially when running under debug mode which can easily slow the computation by a factor of 10.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to '...'
2. Click on '....'
3. Scroll down to '....'
4. See error

**Expected behavior**
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

**Compiler and Operating system**
 Describe compiler with version number and operating system. 

**Additional context**
Add any other context about the problem here.

**Attaching Files**

GitHub restricts files that are attached to an issue to have a name with a "supported" suffix. In
particular, files that have a `.bmad` suffix are not allowed. To get around this, zip together all
the files that are to be attached (`.zip` is an allowed suffix).
