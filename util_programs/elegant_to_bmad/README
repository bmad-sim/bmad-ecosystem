                                    Elegant to Bmad Lattice File Conversion
                                    ---------------------------------------

This README file documents how to convert ELEGANT formatted files to Bmad lattice format.

* Note: For conversion from Bmad to Elegant use the "write elegant" command in the Tao program or
use the bmad_to_mad_sad_elegant program (documentation in bsim/bmad_to_mad_sad_elegant).

Orientation:
------------

This README file is contained in the directory:
  <bmad-dist-or-release>/util_programs/elegant_to_bmad/
Where <bmad-dist-or-release> is the directory of the Distribution or Release that you are using (See
the online Bmad documentation or your local Bmad Guru for more details on Distributions and Releases).

There are two python scrips in this directory:
  elegant_to_bmad.py    -- Converts from Elegant to Bmad format.


How to Convert:
---------------

Minimum python version needed is 3.6.
The scripts run independently of whether the standard Bmad environmental variables have been setup.

To convert Elegant files, use the command:
  <path-to-script>/elegant_to_bmad.py {options} <elegant-file1> <elegant-file2> ...

where <path-to-script> is the path to the directory where the script is and <elegant-file1>,
<elegant-file2> etc. are the names of the files to convert. 

Example conversion command:
  $ACC_ROOT_DIR/util_programs/elegant_to_bmad/elegant_to_bmad -f a.lte
This example converts a Elegant file called "a.lte"
[Note: If you are setup to run Bmad based programs, the ACC_ROOT_DIR environmental variable will be
set to the <bmad-dist-or-release> directory.]

The Bmad output file name is the input file name with the ".lte" suffix removed (if it
exists) and with a ".bmad" suffix appended.

The optional arguments are:
  -h, --help              Show a help message and exit
  -d, --debug             Print debug info while running (not of general interest).
  -f, --many_files        Create a Bmad file for each Elegant input file.
  -c  --constants         Add to lattice file a list of Elegant defined constants.

If the --debug (or -d) option is present, the script will print information on the parsing process
to the terminal. This option is only of interest for someone debugging the code.

By default, only one Bmad output file is produced even when the Elegant input is split among multiple
files that call each other. If The --many_files (or -f) option is present, the script will produce
multiple Bmad output files, one for each Elegant input file.

Note: If a line in the Elegant or ElegantX file begins with the string "!!verbatim", everything after
"!!verbatim" on the line will be put in the Bmad file. This is useful for transferring extra
information to the Bmad file without affecting the reading of the Elegant file by Elegant. Example:
  !!verbatim parameter[geometry] = open
will appear in the Bmad file as:
  parameter[geometry] = open


Limitations:
------------

Bmad, unlike Elegant, does not have any ``action'' commands. An action command is a command that makes a
calculation. 

Many Elegant elements do not have an equivalent Bmad element. Additionally, Elegant elements
generally have attributes with no Bmad equivalent. Thus case should be taken to verify if the
translated Bmad lattice is a good approximation to the Elegant lattice.

When there are tilt, x_pitch (yaw), and/or y_pitch (pitch) misalignments, the translation is exact as long
as either x_pitch or y_pitch is zero. If both are non-zero there is an angular error of order x_pitch*y_pitch.

Notes:
------

By default, Bmad will treat a lattice without \vn{lcavity} elements as having a closed geometry and
a lattice with an \vn{lcavity} as having an open geometry. To override the default, put the following
in the Bmad file (or use the "!!verbatim" construct discussed above):
  parameter[geometry] = open  ! or closed

Help:
-----

* If you find a problem with the conversion, please send a message along with the original Elegant files
to a Bmad maintainer. Contact info can be obtained on the Bmad site by clicking on the "Help &
Mailing Lists" button.

* If you have a lattice with a closed geometry, and the Bmad computed orbit or Twiss parameters are
different enough from the Elegant ones where you suspect a conversion problem, one way to try to
diagnose things is to track in Elegant and Bmad as if the lattice had an open geometry to see if there
are any particular spots in the lattice where differences suddenly become much larger. If you can
spot such places, you can examine the lattice element at that location. 

* Another diagnostic trick is to back translate the Bmad lattice to Elegant. The resulting lattice can then
be compared to the original lattice.
