Program: wake_plot
==================

Program to plot wakes or wake kicks for wakes in a given lattice element.
See the Bmad manual for details on how wakes are parameterized.

Plotted will be the longitudinal and transverse wakes.
For LR wakes the dependent variable is time. For SR wakes the dependent variable is z-position.
An optional postscript file can also be created.


=================================================================================================
Nomenclature:
-------------

LR --> Long range wake
SR --> Short range wake

=================================================================================================
Simulation
----------

The wake is simulated with a leading particle that excites a wake and a trailing "witness" particle
that gets a kick. The charge on the trailing particle is negligible compared with the charge on the
leading particle so the longitudinal self-wake of the trailing particle is negligible.

The wake kicks are the change in phase space px, py, and pz due to the wake.
The only difference between plotting the wakes versus the kicks is an overall scale factor.

Note: For some types of wakes the wake will be zero if xy_leading or xy_trailing are zero.


=================================================================================================
Running the Program
-------------------

To run program
  wake_plot <input_file>
where <input_file> is the name of the input file.
The default input file name is "wake_plot.init".

The program code and example input file can be found in the directory in the bmad-ecosystem repository at:
  util_program/wake_plot


=================================================================================================
Input file syntax
-----------------

An input file uses Fortan namelist syntax. Parameters are read from a namelist named "params"
which looks like:

  &params
		lat_file = "lat.bmad"
    ... etc...
  /

See the example input file in the bmad-ecosystem repo.


=================================================================================================
Non-Plotting Input Prameters:
-----------------------------

lat_file: Bmad lattice file containing the element with the wakes.

wake_ele_name: Wake element identifier. Can be name or element index. Must match to a unique element.

who: What wake type to use. Possibilities are:
        "lr"				-- Long range wakes.
        "sr"				-- Short range wakes.
        "sr-mode"   -- Short range pseudo-mode wakes. Z-position wakes are ignored.
        "sr-long"   -- Short range longitudinal pseudo-mode wake. Only used with ix_wake non-zero.
        "sr-trans"  -- Short range transverse pseudo-mode wake. Only used with ix_wake non-zero.
        "sr-z"			-- Short range Z-position wakes. Pseudo-mode wakes are ignored.
When multiple modes are present, the sum of the wakes is plotted.

m_order: Mode order to plot. Only used with LR wakes. m_order = 1 => dipole wakes, etc. 
Ignored if ix_wake is nonzero. Must be set if there is more than one wake and ix_wake = 0.

ix_wake: Wake index to plot. Only used with who set to "lr", "sr-long", "sr-trans", or "sr-z" where
there is a single list of wakes.  plot only the wake with the index corresponding to ix_wake
(ix_wake = 1 --> Only use first wake in list, etc).  Default is zero which means ignore ix_order. If
non-zero, overrides any setting of m_order.

xy_leading: (x, y) transverse position of the leading particle that produces the wake.

xy_trailing: (x, y) transverse position of the trailing witness particle that samples the wake.

leading_charge: Charge of the leading bunch. Only used when plotting kicks.

=================================================================================================
Plotting Input Parameters:
--------------------------

plot_type: Can be set to "wake" to plot the wake or "kick" to plot the kick

make_plot: If False, do not make a plot (used if only a postscript file is wanted.

postscript_file: If non-blank, Make a postscript file.

Plot_limit: For LR plots, the wake is plotted over a time range [0, plot_limit]. For SR plots,
the wake is plotted over a z range [plot_limit, 0] where plot_limit should be negative in this case.

n_points: Number of data points to use in drawing the wake.

draw_knot_points: Only used with SR wakes. If True, draw symbols on the wake curves at the z-positions
corresponding to the spline knot points of the Z-position wakes.

text_scale: Scale for drawing text. Default is 1.2

plot_size: (width, height) of plot page in pixels (72 pixels = 1 inch).
