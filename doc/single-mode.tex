\chapter{Single Mode}\index{single mode}
\label{c:single}

\index{single mode}
\tao has two \vn{modes} for entering commands. In \vn{Single Mode}, described in this chapter, each
keystroke represents a command.  That is, the user does not have to press the carriage control key
to signal the end of a command (there are a few exceptions which are noted below). Conversely, in
\vn{Line Mode}, which is described in Chapter~\sref{c:command}, \tao waits until the \vn{return} key
is depressed to execute a command. That is, in Line Mode a command consists of a single line of
input.  Single Mode is useful for quickly varying parameters to see how they affect a lattice but
the number of commands in Single Mode is limited.

From \vn{line mode} use the \vn{single_mode} command (\sref{s:sing}) to get into \vn{single
mode}. To go back to \vn{line mode} type "\vn{Z}".

{Ten pairs of keys on the keyboard are bound to ten variables so that pressing a key of a given pair
will either increment or decrement the associated variable. The first key pair bound to variable
number 1 are the \vn{1} and \vn{Q} keys, etc.}

\index{key bindings}
The main purpose of Single Mode is to associate certain keyboard keys with certain variables so that
the pressing of these keys will change their associated model value of the variable as illustrated
in Figure~\ref{f:keyboard}. This is called a \vn{key binding}. Key bindings are established in a
startup file by setting the \vn{var(i)%key_bound} and \vn{var(i)%key_delta} parameters (see
Section~\sref{s:init.var}). After startup, associated variables with keyboard keys can be done using
the \vn{set variable} command (\sref{s:set}).

The variables are divided into banks of 10. The 0\Th bank uses the first ten variables that have
their \vn{key_bound} attribute (\sref{s:init.var}) set to True.  the 1\St bank uses the next ten,
etc.  At any one time, only one bank is active. To see the status of this bank, a \vn{key_table}
plot (\sref{s:key.table})can be setup as shown in Figure~\ref{f:key.table}. The relationship between
the keys and a change in a variable is:
\begin{example}
                 Change by factor of:          
     Variable    -10  -1    1     10
   ----------    ---  ---  ---  -------
    1 + 10*ib     Q    q    1   shift-1   ("!")
    2 + 10*ib     W    w    2   shift-2   ("@")
    3 + 10*ib     E    e    3   shift-3   ("\#")
    4 + 10*ib     R    r    4   shift-4   ("\$")
    5 + 10*ib     T    t    5   shift-5   ("%")
    6 + 10*ib     Y    y    6   shift-6   ("^")
    7 + 10*ib     U    u    7   shift-7   ("\&")
    8 + 10*ib     I    i    8   shift-8   ("*")
    9 + 10*ib     O    o    9   shift-9   ("(")
   10 + 10*ib     P    p    0   shift-0   (")")
\end{example}
In the above table ib is the bank number (0 for the
0\Th bank, etc.), and the change is in multiples of the \vn{step} (\sref{s:init.var}).  value for a
variable. Note: In \vn{line mode}, the command \vn{show key_bindings} (\sref{s:show}) may be used to
show the entire set of bound keys.

Initially the 0\Th bank is active. The left arrow and right arrow are used to decrease or increase
the bank number.  Additionally the "\vn{<}" and "$>$" keys can be used to change the deltas for the
variables.

For example, looking at Figure~\ref{f:key.table}, the \vn{"1:"} in the upper left corner of the
\vn{Key Table} shows that the 1\St bank is active. \vn{key(14)} is associated with the \vn{"4"} key
and from the \vn{Key Table} it is seen that the bound attribute is the \vn{b1_gradient} of the
element named \vn{Q15_2}.  Thus, if the \vn{"4"} key is depressed in single mode, the value of the
\vn{b1_gradient} of element \vn{Q15_2} will be increased by the given Delta (0.1000 in this
case). Pressing the \vn{"r"} key (which is just below the \vn{"4"} key) will decrease the value of
the \vn{b1_gradient} by 0.1000. Using the shift key, which is shift-4 (\vn{"\$"}) will increase
\vn{b1_gradient} by 10 times the given delta (1.000 in this case) and \vn{"R"} will decrease, by a
factor of 10, the given delta.

Since element \vn{Q15_2} is also displayed in the \vn{Lattice Layout}, there is a \vn{"4"} drawn
above this element that reflects the fact that the element contains a bound attribute. Since, in
this case, the Lattice Layout only shows part of the lattice, not all key indexes are present.

\section{List of Key Strokes}\index{single mode!list of Key strokes}
\label{s:keys}

In the following list, certain commands use multiple key strokes. For example, the \vn{"/v"} command
is invoked by first pressing the slash (\vn{"/"}) key followed by the \vn{"v"} key. \vn{"a
$<$left_arrow$>$"} represents pressing the \vn{"a"} key followed by the left-arrow key.

Additionally, custom commands can be associated with any key using the \vn{set key} command
\sref{s:set}. Example:
\begin{example}
  set key h = veto var *  ! This sets the "h" key to the command "veto var *"
\end{example}

\item[c]  
Show constraints.

\item[g]
Go run the default optimizer (\sref{s:tao.opti}). The optimizer will run until you type a '.' (a
period).  Periodically during the optimization the variable values will be written to files, one for
each universe, whose name is \vn{tao_opt_vars\#.dat}. where \vn{\#} is the universe number.

\item[v]
Show Bmad variable values in bmad lattice format. See also the \vn{/v} command. Equivalent to
\vn{show vars -bmad} in line mode.

\item[V] 
Same an \vn{v} except only variables currently enabled for optimization are shown.
This is equivalent to \vn{show vars -bmad -good} in line mode.

\item[Z] 
Go back to \vn{line mode}

\item[$<$]
Reduce the deltas (the amount that a variable is changed when you use
the keys 0 through 9) of all the variables by a factor of 2.

\item[$>$]
Increase the deltas (the amount that a variable is changed when you
use the keys 0 through 9) of all the variables by a factor of 2.

\item[$<$left\_arrow$>$]
Shift the active key bank down by 1: ib -$>$ ib - 1

\item[$<$right\_arrow$>$]
Shift the active key bank up by 1: ib -$>$ ib + 1

\item[/$<$up\_arrow$>$]

\item[/$<$down\_arrow$>$]

\item['$<$command$>$]
Accept a Line Mode (\sref{c:command}) command.

\item[/b]
Switch the default lattice branch (\sref{s:lattice}).

\item[/e $<$Index or Name$>$]
Prints info on a lattice element. If there are two lattices being used and only the information of
an element from one particular lattice is wanted then prepend with "n@" where n is the lattice
index.

\item[/l]
Print a list of the lattice elements with Twiss parameters.

\item[/u $<$Universe Index$>$]
Switch the default universe (\sref{s:universe}).

\item[/v]
Write variable values to the default output file in Bmad lattice format.  The default output file
name is set by \vn{global%var_out}.  See also the \vn{V} command.

\item[/x $<$min$>$ $<$max$>$]
Set the horizontal scale min and max values for all the plots. This is the same as setting
\vn{default_graph%x%min} and \vn{default_graph%x%max} in the \tao input file. If \vn{min} and
\vn{max} are not given then the scale will be chosen to include the entire lattice.

\item[/y $<$min$>$ $<$max$>$]
Set the y-axis min and max values for all the plots. This is the same as setting \vn{plot%y%min} and
\vn{plot%y%max} in the \tao input file. If \vn{min} and \vn{max} are not given then an autoscale
will be done.

\item[=v $<$digit$>$ $<$value$>$]
Set variable value. \vn{<digit>} is between 0 and 9 corresponding to a
variable of the current bank. \vn{<value>} is the value to set the
variable to.

\item[=$<$right\_arrow$>$]
Set saved ("value0") values to variable values to saved values. The saved values (the value0 column
in the display) are initially set to the initial value on startup. There are saved values for both
the manual and automatic variables. Note that reading in a TOAD input file will reset the saved
values. If you want to save the values of the variables in this case use "/w" to save to a file. Use
the "\vn{/$<$left_arrow$>$}" command to go in the reverse direction.

\item[=$<$left\_arrow$>$]
Paste saved (\vn{value0} column in the display) values back to the variable values.  The saved
values are initially set to the initial value on startup. Use the "\vn{/$<$right_arrow$>$}" command
to go in the reverse direction.
