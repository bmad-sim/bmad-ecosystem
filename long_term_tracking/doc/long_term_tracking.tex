\Section{Introduction} 

The \ltt program is for long term tracking of a particle or beam possibly
including tracking of the spin.

The \ltt program is built atop the the Bmad software library \cite{b:bmad}. The Bmad library,
developed at Cornell, has been developed for modeling relativistic charged particles in storage
rings and Linacs, as well as modeling photons in x-ray beam lines.

\ltt comes in two versions: A single threaded version whose executable is called
\vn{long_term_tracking} and an parallel compute version using MPI whose executable is called
\vn{long_term_tracking_mpi}. [Note to Distribution maintainers: The single threaded version will
always be built when compiling the Distribution. The MPI version can be built by building the
Distribution with MPI enabled. See the documentation on the Bmad web site for more details.]

%------------------------------------------------------------------
\Section{Running the Long Term Tracking Program} 
\label{s:run}

See the documentation for setting up the Bmad environmental variables at
\begin{code}
  \url{https://wiki.classe.cornell.edu/ACC/ACL/RunningPrograms}
\end{code}

Once the Bmad environmental variables have bee set, the syntax for invoking the single threaded
version of the \ltt program is:
\begin{code}
  long_term_tracking {-write} {<master_input_file_name>}
\end{code}
Example:
\begin{code}
  long_term_tracking my_input_file.init
\end{code}
The \vn{<master_input_file_name>} optional argument is used to set the master input file name. The
default is ``\vn{long_term_tracking.init}''. If the optional \vn{-write} switch is present, the
1-turn map will be written to a file.

Example input files are in the directory:
\begin{code}
  $ACC_ROOT_DIR/bsim/long_turn_tracking/example
\end{code}

To run the parallel version of \ltt, see the documentation on running programs on the Bmad web site
for more details.

%------------------------------------------------------------------
\Section{Simulation Modes}
\label{s:sim.modes}

There are a number of simulation ``modes'' which determine what is done by the program. The
simulation mode is set by the \vn{ltt%simulation_mode} parameter in the master input file
(\sref{s:input}).  Possible settings of \vn{ltt%simulation_mode} are:
\begin{code}
  "CHECK"   ! Quick map check.
  "SINGLE"  ! Single particle tracking.
  "BUNCH"   ! Bunch tracking.
  "STAT"    ! Lattice statistics.
\end{code}

\begin{description}
\item["CHECK"] \Newline
In this mode a particle is tracked for one turn using a 1-turn map and, using the exact same
starting conditions, tracked element-by-element for one turn. The results are then printed to the
terminal. This mode can be used to get a sense of how accurate the 1-turn map is.

No data files are produced in this mode.
%
\item["SINGLE"] \Newline
In this mode a single particle is tracked for \vn{ltt%n_turns} turns. The name of the data file is set
by the \vn{ltt%particle_output_file} parameter (\sref{s:input}). The particle position will be output every

%
\item["BUNCH"] \Newline
In this mode a particle bunch is tracked for \vn{ltt%n_turns} turns. The output data file(s) format is
described in Section~\sref{s:part.out}.
%
\item["STAT"] \Newline
In this mode statistics about the lattice are calculated. No long term tracking is done.

Three data files are produced: 
\begin{code}
  twiss.dat         ! Twiss parameters
  coupling.dat      ! Coupling parameters
  closed_orbit.dat  ! Closed orbit
\end{code}
\end{description}


%------------------------------------------------------------------
\Section{Using 1-turn Maps and PTC}
\label{s:map}

The \ltt program uses the PTC/FPP library of \'Etienne Forest to handle Taylor maps to any arbitrary
order. In particular, PTC is used for constructing the 1-turn map used for tracking when the
\vn{ltt%tracking_method} parameter is set to "\vn{MAP}" (\sref{s:sim.params}). PTC tracking is also
used when \vn{ltt%tracking_method} is set to "\vn{PTC}". In this case tracking is done
element-by-element.

There are a few points to keep in mind. First is that \vn{PTC} trackes through a lattice element
step by step. This means that the setting of \vn{num_steps} (or equivalently \vn{ds_step}) for each
element will affect the accuracy and speed of the computations. Bmad tries to choose reasonable
default settings for the number of steps however the calculation is not perfect. To make sure that
the number of steps is set properly, vary the number of steps and choose a step size (which will be
different for different elements) such that the number of steps is minimal (to minimize computation
time) while at the same time is large enough so that results do not change significantly if the
number of steps is increased.

Another thing to keep in mind is that whether a 1-turn map will give accurate results is dependent
on a number of factors. One factor is the order of the map. Generally higher order is better but
will take more computation time. But all maps with order larger than 1 will be limited to tracking
partices that are far from any strong resonances. That is, if you are interested in tracking halo
particles you probably should not be using a 1-turn map.

In terms of speed, using a 1-turn map will be the fastest, using standard Bmad tracking will be much
slower, and using PTC element-by-element tracking will be slowest.

In terms of symplecticity, both the PTC tracking and the 1-turn map tracking will be symplectic.
Bmad is not symplectic but the deviation from symplecticity is generally fairly small. If the
radiation effects are large enough, the radiative stochastic noise will negate any non-symplectic
effects and standard Bmad tracking can be used. A very rough rule of thumb is that if the damping times
or the number of turns tracked are under 100,000 turns then Bmad standard tracking can be used.

PTC element-by-element tracking cannot be done when using the MPI version of the \ltt program.

%------------------------------------------------------------------
\Section{Particle Tracking}
\label{s:track.modes}

Tracking can be done on an element-by-element basis or using a one-turn map that includes radiation
damping and fluctuations and includes both orbital and spin transport. The map is actually three maps
rolled into one. One map is a map with out radiation, another map simulates radiation damping, and
the third map, with the help of a random number generator, is used to include radiation fluctuations.
radiation damping and/or fluctuations will or will not be included in tracking depending upon the
settings of (\sref{s:input}):
\begin{code}
  bmad_com%radiation_damping_on
  bmad_com%radiation_fluctuations_on
\end{code}
Note: When tracking with a map, the RF cavities must be powered so that there are synchrotron
oscillations.

What tracking mode is used is determined by the \vn{ltt%tracking_method} switch (\sref{s:input})
which is used to determine if tracking is done using a map or not. If a map is used, the order of
the map (the degree at which the Taylor series comprising the map are truncated) is given by
\vn{ltt%map_order} parameter. A larger map order will mean better accuracy at the expense of more
computation time. Tracking using a map will be extremely quick compared to element-by-element
tracking. However, map tracking can be inaccurate if the map order is too small or the particle
amplitude is too large.

Maps can be saved to a file for later use. Saved maps always include the radiation fluctuations
component map independent of the setting of \vn{bmad_com%radiation_fluctuations_on}. Thus, when a
saved map is used for tracking, whether radiation fluctuations is included is determined by the
setting of \vn{bmad_com%radiation_fluctuations_on} at the time the map file is read in independent of
the setting at the time the map file is created. Radiation damping is handled differently. The
radiation damping component map depends on the setting of \vn{bmad_com%radiation_damping_on}. Thus,
when a saved map is used for tracking, radiation damping is included only if
\vn{bmad_com%radiation_damping_on} was set True both at the time the map file was created and when
the map file is read back in. The reason why radiation damping is handled differently from radiation
fluctuations is due to the fact that the spin tracking part of the map is always created with respect
to the closed orbit and the closed orbit will be different if radiation damping is on versus
off. [The closed orbit is always calculated ignoring radiation fluctuations though.] If you don't
care about spin tracking, it generally makes sense to always create maps that have damping.

%------------------------------------------------------------------
\Section{Initial Particle Positions}
\label{s:init.pos}

When the \vn{ltt%simulation_mode} (\sref{s:sim.modes}) is set to \vn{"SINGLE"} or \vn{"CHECK"}, the
initial particle position is determined by the \vn{beam_init%center} and \vn{beam_init%spin}
components of the \vn{beam_init} structure (\sref{s:input}) in the master input file. If the
\vn{ltt%add_closed_orbit_to_init_position} logical is set to \vn{True}, the closed orbit position is added to
\vn{beam_init%center} to get the initial particle position.

When the \vn{ltt%simulation_mode} is set to \vn{"BUNCH"}, the initial particle positions are calculated
using the \vn{beam_init} structure as discussed in the \vn{Beam Initialization} chapter of the Bmad
manual. Like the other modes, if the \vn{ltt%add_closed_orbit_to_init_position} logical is set to
\vn{True}, the closed orbit position is added to the initial particle positions. To read in a file
with beam particle positions, set the \vn{beam_init} structure appropriately. Example:
\begin{code}
  beam_init%file_name = 'beam_particle_file.init'
\end{code}

In all cases, tracking will start at the lattice element set by \vn{ltt%ele_start_name}.

%------------------------------------------------------------------
\Section{Fortran Namelist}
\label{s:namelist}

Fortran namelist syntax is used for parameter input. The
general form of a namelist is
\begin{code}
&<namelist_name>
  <var1> = ...
  <var2> = ...
  ...
/
\end{code}
The tag \vn{"\&<namelist_name>"} starts the namelist where
\vn{<namelist_name>} is the name of the namelist. The namelist ends
with the slash \vn{"/"} tag. Anything outside of this is
ignored. Within the namelist, anything after an exclamation mark
\vn{"!"} is ignored including the exclamation mark. \vn{<var1>},
\vn{<var2>}, etc. are variable names. Example:
\begin{code}
&place 
  section = 0.0, "arc_std", "elliptical", 0.045, 0.025 
/
\end{code}
here \vn{place} is the namelist name and \vn{section} is a
variable name.  Notice that here \vn{section} is a ``structure'' which
has five components -- a real number, followed by two strings,
followed by two real numbers.

Everything is case insensitive except for quoted strings.

Logical values are specified by \vn{True} or \vn{False} or can be
abbreviated \vn{T} or \vn{F}. Avoid using the dots (periods) that one
needs in Fortran code.

\newpage

%------------------------------------------------------------------
\Section{Master Input File}
\label{s:input}

The master input file holds the parameters needed for running the long term tracking program. The
master input file must contain a single namelist (\sref{s:namelist}) named \vn{params}.  Example:
\begin{code}
&params
  ! Input files
  ltt%lat_file   =  "lat.bmad"     ! Bmad lattice file
  ltt%map_file = 'order5.map'
  ltt%common_master_input_file = ""

  ! Output parameters
  ltt%particle_output_file = "snap.dat"
  ltt%averages_output_file = "average.dat"  
  ltt%sigma_matrix_output_file = "sigma.dat"
  ltt%output_every_n_turns = 200
  ltt%output_initial_position = False
  ltt%print_on_dead_loss = -1
  ltt%merge_particle_output_files = False

  ! Simulation parameters
  ltt%simulation_mode    = "BUNCH"
  ltt%tracking_method    = 'BMAD'
  ltt%ele_start_name     = ""
  ltt%n_turns            = 1000
  ltt%map_order          = 5
  ltt%rfcavity_on        = True
  ltt%timer_print_dtime  = 300
  ltt%random_seed        = 0
  ltt%ptc_aperture       = 0.1, 0.1
  ltt%add_closed_orbit_to_init_position = True
  ltt%dead_cutoff = -1
  ltt%b_emittance = 1e-9                 ! Used with space charge calc.

  bmad_com%spin_tracking_on = T          ! See Bmad manual for 
  bmad_com%radiation_damping_on = F      !    bmad_com parameters.
  bmad_com%radiation_fluctuations_on = F 
  bmad_com%space_charge_on = F

  beam_init%n_particle = 10
  beam_init%spin = 0, 1, 0        ! See Bmad manual for 
  beam_init%a_emit = 1e-8         !    beam_init_struct parameters.
  beam_init%b_emit = 1e-8
  beam_init%sig_z = 1e-4
  beam_init%sig_pz = 1e-4
/
\end{code}

\newpage

The namelist parameters can be divided into three categories: Input files, output parameters, and
simulation parameters.

%----------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Input Files}

The input files that can be specified in the \vn{params} namelist of the master input file are:
\begin{description}
\item[ttl\%common_master_input_file] \Newline
The \vn{common_master_input_file} is used in situations where you want to run multipole simulations
with multiple initialization files and where most parameters are the same across all the
simulations. In this case, an initialization file containing the parameters that are the same can be
created along with individual initialization files one for each simulation. The individual files
should set \vn{common_master_input_file} to the name of the common file and the individual files
should only set the parameters that are different for that simulation. Parameter values set in the
individual files will override values set in the common file. Using a common master input file means
that there is only one file to modify when common parameters are changed as opposed to having to
modify all the initialization files. If \vn{common_master_input_file} is set to blank (the default),
no common file is used
%
\item[ttl\%lat_file] \Newline
Name of the Bmad lattice file to use. This name is required.
%
\item[ttl\%map_file] \Newline
If the \vn{-write} switch is present on the command line when the long_term_tracking program in
involked, the 1-turn map is created and written to a file whose name is given by
\vn{ttl%map_file}. If \vn{ttl%map_file} is blank, a default name will be constructed. The saved map
will be affected by the setting of \vn{bmad_com%radiation_damping_on}. See \sref{s:track.modes} for
more details.

If the \vn{-write} switch is not present, the 1-turn map is read in from \vn{ttl%map_file} if it
exists.  If the order of the map that is read in does not agree with the setting of
\vn{ttl%map_order} or the map's \vn{radiation_damping_on} setting does not agree with the setting of
\vn{bmad_com%radiation_damping_on}, the map is ignored and a new one generated for use in tracking.
\end{description}

%----------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Output Parameters}

\begin{description}
\item[ltt\%averages_output_file] \Newline
Used with \vn{ltt%simulation_mode} set to \vn{"BUNCH"}. The name of the file that contain orbital
and spin positions averaged over all the particles of the bunch as well as the six beam size sigmas
($\sigma_x$, $\sigma_{px}$, etc.).  Each line in the file represents the averages at the end of a
turn and a new line is added every \vn{ltt%ouput_every_n_turns} number of turns. If
\vn{ltt%averages_output_file} is blank, no averages file is produced. Data is always recorded when
the beam is at the \vn{ltt%ele_start_name} position independent of where the lattice begins and
ends. Note: The file \vn{ltt%sigma_matrix_output_file} will show the full 6x6 sigma matrix.
%
\item[ltt\%merge_particle_output_files] \Newline
If set to \vn{True}, all the particle data will be put in one \vn{ltt%particle_output_file} file. Only
relevant for \vn{"BEAM"} tracking.  See Section~\sref{s:part.out}.
%
\item[ltt\%output_every_n_turns] \Newline
Sets the number of turns between files specified by \vn{ltt%averages_output_file} and
\vn{ltt%particle_output_file}.
%
\item[ltt\%output_initial_position] \Newline
Used with \vn{ltt%simulation_mode} set to \vn{"BUNCH"}. If \vn{ltt%output_initial_position} is set to
\vn{True}, additional columns will be added to the output tracking data file to show the initial
particle position and spin. Default is \vn{False}. See Section~\sref{s:part.out}.
%
\item[ltt\%particle_output_file] \Newline
Used with \vn{ltt%simulation_mode} set to \vn{"BUNCH"}. The name of the file or files that are created
to hold the particle positions. If \vn{ltt%merge_particle_output_files} is set to False, a file is
created every \vn{ltt%ouput_every_n_turns} turns.  If \vn{ltt%merge_particle_ouput_files} is set to True,
the files are combined into one. See Section~\sref{s:part.out} for more details. If
\vn{ltt%particle_ouput_file} is blank, no particle output file is created.
%
\item[ltt\%print_on_dead_loss] \Newline
After each turn, the number of particles that are still living (have not hit an aperture) are
counted and if the percentage of particles that have died, counting from the last time a message was
printed, is larger than \vn{ltt%print_on_dead_loss}, a message is printed. For example, if
\vn{ltt%print_on_dead_loss} is set to 0.01, every time the beam loses 1\% of the particles a message is printed.
Default is -1 which will cause a message printed every turn where there is particle loss.
%
\item[ltt\%ptc_aperture] \Newline
The PTC code does not have apertures. This being the case, for \vn{ltt%tracking_method} set to
\vn{"MAP"} or \vn{"PTC"}, \vn{ltt%ptc_aperture}, which is a 2-vector, defines \vn{x} and \vn{y}
apertures. The default is 0.1~meter in both the horizontal and vertical. When used, the aperture is
applied at the beginning/end of the lattice. PTC has an internal aperture of 1.0~meter. To be safe,
the \ltt program will additionally impose a 0.9~meters aperture independent of the setting of
\vn{ltt%ptc_aperture}.
%
\item[ltt\%sigma_matrix_output_file] \Newline
String specifying the name of the file to create to hold the calculated 6x6 sigma matrix. If blank (the
default), no sigma matrix file will be created. The 6x6 sigma matrix $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$ is a
measure of the beam size defined by
\begin{equation}
  \sigma_{ij} = \left< dr_i \, dr_j \right>
\end{equation}
where $\bf dr$ is the deviation of the particle phase space position from the average and $<\ldots>$
denotes an average over all particles. 

With \vn{ltt%simulation_mode} set to \vn{"BUNCH"}, Each line in the file represents the averages at
the end of a turn and a new line is added every \vn{ltt%ouput_every_n_turns} number of turns. With
\vn{ltt%simulation_mode} set to "SINGLE"), The average is done over all the turns. Data is always
recorded when the beam is at the \vn{ltt%ele_start_name} position independent of where the lattice
begins and ends.

Also see the \vn{ltt%averages_output_file} parameter.

\end{description}

%----------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Simulation Parameters}
\label{s:sim.params}

\begin{description}
\item[ltt\%a_emittance, ltt\%b_emittance] \Newline
Emittances used in the high energy space charge calculation (\sref{s:space.charge}). If set to zero
(the default), the emittance as calculated via radiation integrals will be used.

\item[ltt\%add_closed_orbit_to_init_position] \Newline
If set \vn{True} (the default), initial particle positions are set equal to the input particle positions
plus the closed orbit position. See Section~\sref{s:init.pos}.
%
\item[beam_init\%...] \Newline
This sets the initial beam distribution. See Section~\sref{s:init.pos}.
%
\item[bmad_com\%...] \Newline
The \vn{bmad_com} structure contains various parameters that affect tracking. For example, whether
radiation damping and fluctuations are included in tracking. A full list of \vn{bmad_com} parameters
is detailed in the Bmad reference manual. The \vn{bmad_com%space_charge_on} logical can be used to
turn on/off ultra-relativistic space charge effects. See section~\sref{s:space.charge} for more
details. Note: \vn{bmad_com} parameters can be set in the Bmad lattice file as well. \vn{Bmad_com}
parameter set in the master input file will take precedence over parameters set in the lattice file.
%
\item[ltt\%dead_cutoff] \Newline
Sets the cutoff for the number of dead particles below which the simulation will stop. For example,
if \vn{ltt%dead_cutoff} is set to 0.01, when 1\% of the beam has been lost the simulation will stop. The
default value for \vn{ltt%dead_cutoff} is zero.
%
\item[ltt\%ele_start_name] \Newline
Name or element index of the element to start the tracking. Examples:
\begin{code}
  ele_start_name = "Q3##2"   ! 2nd element named Q3 in the lattice.
  ele_start_name = 37        ! 37th element in the lattice.
\end{code}
The default is to start at the beginning of the lattice. Notice that the tracking starts at the
downstream end of the element so the first element tracked through is the element after the chosen
one.
%
\item[ltt\%map_order] \Newline
Order of the 1-turn map. See Section~\sref{s:track.modes}. The default is what is set in the lattice
file and if not set in the lattice file the default is 3. Note: \vn{ltt%map_order} is only used when
generating a map.  When a map is read in from a file, the order of this map is independent of the
current setting of \vn{ltt%map_order}.
%
\item[ltt\%n_turns] \Newline
Number of turns to track. See Section~\sref{s:track.modes}.
%
\item[ltt\%random_seed] \Newline
The random number seed used by the random number generator. If set to 0, the
system clock will be used. That is, if set to 0, the output results will vary from run to run.
%
\item[ltt\%rfcavity_on] \Newline
If set to \vn{False}, the voltage on all RF cavity elements will be turned off. Default is \vn{True}.
If 1-turn map tracking is used, the RF voltage may not be turned off.
%
\item[ltt\%simulation_mode] \Newline
Sets the simulation mode for the program. See Section~\sref{s:sim.modes}.
%
\item[ltt\%timer_print_dtime] \Newline
The program will print a tracking status message every so often. The nominal time between status
messages is set by \vn{ltt%timer_print_dtime} which is a number in seconds.
%
\item[ltt\%tracking_method] \Newline
String switch which sets how particles are tracked when the \vn{simulation_mode} is set to
"\vn{BUNCH}" or "\vn{SINGLE}". Possible settings are:
\begin{code}
  "MAP"         ! 1-turn map tracking.
  "PTC"         ! Element-by-element tracking with PTC.
  "BMAD"        ! Element-by-element tracking using Bmad. Default
\end{code}
See sections \sref{s:map} and \vn{s:track.modes} for more details.
\end{description}

%------------------------------------------------------------------
\Section{simulations with Ultra-Relativistic Space Charge Effects}
\label{s:space.charge}

A space charge kick can be applied in the simulation. The space charge kick is calculated using an
approximation suitable at ultra-relativistic energies. The kick is turned on by setting
the logical \vn{bmad_com%space_charge_on} to \vn{True} (default is \vn{False}. See the Bmad
manual documentation on \vn{bmad_com%space_charge_on} for more details.

The $a$ and $b$ mode emittances are used as input to the space charge calculation. [If there is no
coupling, the $a$ mode corresponds to the ``horizontal'' mode and the $b$ mode corresponds to the
``vertical'' mode.] These emittance can be sepcified by setting \vn{ltt%a_emittance} and/or
\vn{ltt%b_emittance}. If set to zero (the default), an emittance is calculated using a radiation
integral calculation. Additionaly, the longitudinal beam size is calculated via radiation integrals.

%------------------------------------------------------------------
\Section{Particle Data Output Format}
\label{s:part.out}

The following describes the particle data output format. Particle data is outputted when the
\vn{ltt%simulation_mode} is set to \vn{"BUNCH"}.

Particle data is always recorded when the beam is at the \vn{ltt%ele_start_name} position independent of
where the lattice begins and ends.

With \vn{ltt%merge_particle_output_files} set to \vn{False}, an output data file will be produced every
\vn{ltt%output_every_n_turns} turns. Each line in this file records a particle's orbital and
spin position. The name of the data file is derived from the \vn{ltt%particle_output_file} string using
the following rules: If \vn{ltt%particle_output_file} contains a hash character ''\#'', the data file name
is formed by substituting the turn number for the hash token. If there is no hash character, the
data file name is formed by appending the turn number to the \vn{ltt%particle_output_file} string.

With \vn{ltt%merge_particle_output_files} set to \vn{True}, instead of generating multiple files, all data is
put into one file whose name is given by \vn{ltt%particle_output_file}.

Nominally particle data is recorded every \vn{ltt%output_every_n_turns} number of
turns. However, if \vn{ltt%output_every_n_turns} is set to 0, particle data is recorded only
at the start and end of the tracking. If \vn{ltt%output_every_n_turns} is set to -1,
particle data is only recorded at the end of tracking.

If \vn{ltt%output_initial_position} is set to \vn{True}, additional columns will be added to the output
particle data file to show the initial particle position and spin.
