Example of How to Create a Customized Version of Tao 
---------------------------------------------------

This example uses real data from the Fermilab Recycler NOvA Ring curtesy of Meiqin Xiao.
Paper:
	Linear Modelling and Lattice Correction from Betatron Phase Measurements at the Fermilab Recycler NOvA Ring
	Meiqin Xiao(Fermilab), Kyle Hazelwood(Fermilab), Ming-Jen Yang(Fermilab), R. Ainsword(Fermilab)

Directory:
	tao/examples/custom_tao_with_measured_data

Purpose:
  Create a customized version of Tao to read in "ping data" for analysis.

Custom code file:
	custom_tao_with_measured_data/tao_hook_command.f90

How to compile:
	Go to the custom_tao_with_measured_data directory and issue the "mk" command.

Executable will be created at:
	tao/examples/production/bin/ping_tao

To run ping_tao, go to the custom_tao_with_measured_data directory and use the command:
	../production/bin/ping_tao

Writeup: See the Tao manual section "Reading in Measured Data Example" for more details.
