Documentation for Regression Testing of Bmad

------------------------------------------------- 
Overview:

The regression testing works by running programs and comparing the program output to a file which
has the "correct" output.

The main "regression_tests" directory contains a file called "TESTS.LIST".  In this file is a list
of subdirectories of "regression_tests". These subdirectories are called the "regression"
subdirectories. 

When the regression test script is run, each regression subdirectory is visited in turn. In each
regression subdirectory, the appropriate program is run. The name of the program is assumed to be
the same as the name of the regression subdirectory. However, if the regression subdirectory has a
file name "run.py", this script is run instead of any program. If 'run.py' is executed, the
directory where the regression test script is looking for executable program files is passed as the
first (and only) argument to run.py.

The program will create an output file called "output.now".  The regression script will compare this
file to an existing file in the subdirectory named "output.correct". The regression test is
successful if the numbers in two files are the same within the tolerances given in the "output.now"
file. See the "Constructing a new test" section for details on the syntax of these files.

The results of the regression test is stored in a file named "regression.results".

For the purposes of assigning an overall "passing" or "failing" grade to the regression tests when
the run_test.py script is run within a job script, for each regression subdirectory there is a
maximum allowable number of tests that can be failed. This number is set in TESTS.LIST and the
default is zero. If the number of tests failed for any regression subdirectory is greater than the
maximum allowable for that subdirectory, the run_test.py script will exit at the end with a non-zero
exit code indicating overall regression failure. Setting a non-zero maximum failure number should
only be done as a temparary measure to allow job scripts to run smoothly. Note: If run_test.py is
run with the -test option, it is assumed that the testing is not done within a script an the maximum
allowable failures is take to be zero since the pass/fail grade does not matter in this case.

------------------------------------------------- 
Running the Tests:

0) Do everything in the the regression_tests directory.

1) If needed, compile and link the programs:
      make DO_EXTRA_MAKES=Y
The executables are created in:
      ../bin/

2) Run the testing script:
Usage:
   scripts/run_test.py {-bin <exe_dir>} {-test <test_dir>} {-list <test_list_file>} {-debug}

Defaults:
   <exe_dir>  = "../bin"          ! This is relative to current directory.
   <test_dir> = ""                ! For running a single test. Overrides using a test_list_file.
   <test_list_file> = "test.list" ! For running multiple tests.

<exe_dir> is the directory where all the programs are.  If <exe_dir> is a relative path name, it
must be relative to any subdirectory of regression_tests.  <exe_dir> is optional and, if not
present, will default to "../../bin"

3) The results will be saved in a file "regression.results"

------------------------------------------------- 
Constructing a new test:

1) Create a new subdirectory of regression_tests. For this documentation call this subdirectory
"zzz".

2) Add a line to the "regression_tests/TESTS.LIST" file. Each line in this file is a subdirectory
name indicating the subdirectory containing the test code. Note: Lines starting with an exclamation
mark "!"  are printed to the terminal but are otherwise ignored. After the subdirectory name, an
optional number indicates the maximum number of tests that can be failed without triggering an error
exit code at the end of all the tests (see above). For example, the number "4" would indicate that
it is acceptable if the number of tests failed was four or less.

3) If needed: In this subdirectory put your testing program code and any input files needed for
running the program. Additionally, a file "output.correct" needs to be present containing the
expected output of the program. Generation of this file is detailed below.

3) When the program is run, it must generate a file called "output.now".  This file will be compared
to "output.correct".

4) The format of the "output.now" and "output.correct" files are as follows: Lines that
are blank or that begin with a "!" exclamation character are ignored.  All other
"specification" lines have the syntax:
  "<tag_string>"  <data_id>  <tolerance>  <value_1>  <value_2>  ...
where:
  <tag_string>     = Identification string associated with the line.
  <data_id>        = How to interpret the data. 
  <tolerance>      = Allowable tolerance to pass test. Absent for STR data.
  <value_1>, etc.  = List of values. Must use double quotes for STR data.
Double quote marks must be used to surround the <tag_string> field.
The <data_id> field can be one of:
  STR            String or logical data.
  REL            Real data with relative tolerance.
  VEC_REL        Real data with tolerance relative to the vector magnitude of the array of numbers on the line
  ABS            Real data with absolute tolerance.

The specification lines of "output.correct" and "output.now" must match up.  That is, the N^th
specification line of "output.correct" and the N^th specification line in "output.now" must have the
same <tag_string> and the same number of values. Also the <tag_string> used for different lines
should be unique.

Example specification lines for "output.now":
  "Orbit at s = 34.5"  REL  1e-4  0.023  -0.0079  0.0060 
  "Element Names"      STR  "ABC cat"  "XYZ dog"

In this example the "Orbit at s = 34.5" data has values 0.023, -0.0079, and 0.0060.  The tolerance
is relative so to pass testing the corresponding values in "output.correct" must not differ by more
than 0.01%

5) CMake setup for compiling/linking the program:
  A) Add a "cmake.zzz" script in the regression_tests directory. 
Use, say, the existing "cmake.twiss_track_test" file as a template.  In the cmake.zzz
makefile substitute "zzz" for "twiss_track_test".
  B) Edit the "CMakeLists.txt" in the regression_tests directory 
and add "cmake.zzz" to the EXE_SPECS list.

6) To generate the "output.correct" file: 
  A) first run the program to generate the "output.now" file.  
  B) Copy "output.now" to "output.correct".

7) You are now done. The scripts/run_tests.py script will parse the TESTS.LIST file in
order to determine the list of programs to be run.

Guideline:
  Make the running time for programs short. Typical running times are less than a minute

------------------------------------------------- 
Using Regression Programs for Custom Exploration:

Sometimes it is convenient to be able to run a regression test with a modified input file and for
the test to output more than it would output normally. This "custom exploration" mode has been built
into a number of tests. For example, the mat6_calc_method_test has a "custom exploration" mode that
can be used to compare the transfer matrix as computed with different tracking methods. In all
programs that have been configured for custom exploration, the custom exploration is triggered if an
input file is specified on the command line. If custom exploration is triggered, a flag called
print_extra is set to True to signal custom output.
